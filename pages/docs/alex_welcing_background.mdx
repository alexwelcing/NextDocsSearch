My work included the creation of AI-driven document scanning and image selection, which increased the precision of our product knowledge graph and reduced human error.

As a Consultant and Client Portal Administrator from August 2017 to January 2020, still with **Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP**, I was responsible for the successful launch and operation of a client-exclusive publishing SaaS platform. This platform significantly contributed to the firm's Annual Recurring Revenue by enabling in-depth data analysis for internal executives and overseeing publication data reporting and security.

I also have experience as a Consultant with **Marketing Systems** (February 2016 - January 2017) where I managed project development for digital and social campaigns. My strategies employed systems modeling and AI-driven segmentation to enhance client marketing efforts.

My tenure as a Digital Sales Executive at **YP** (July 2015 - November 2015) had me specializing in large opportunity management focused on search and display ads. I utilized my technical expertise in geo-targeted mobile banners and contributed significantly to the sales pipeline.

Before YP, I was a Marketing Campaign Manager at **Texas Print Solutions** (May 2014 - July 2015) where I developed a web portal with a 360 product viewer for e-commerce launch and managed Google Drive integration for inventory management.

As a Marketing Coordinator for **Goody Goody Liquor** (May 2013 - December 2013), I managed product launches and digital marketing campaigns. I also partnered with TracyLocke to oversee media and design product ads, utilizing Google Analytics to derive insights for over 20 retail locations.
