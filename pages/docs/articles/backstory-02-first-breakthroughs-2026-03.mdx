# First Breakthroughs

**March 12, 2026**

Coffee with the quantum team today. Can't share details but their error correction approach is... unconventional. And it's working. They're seeing coherence times no one thought possible.

Academic papers are 5 years behind what's in this building.

Late night in the lab. We hit a milestone today that I literally can't talk about. But if you've been following transformer architecture evolution... imagine that, but 1000x.

My advisor would lose his mind if he knew what we just did.

Team celebration today. Can't say what for, but champagne was involved.

Also: First time I realized we might be building something that changes... everything.

Also also: First time I felt a little scared.

This was when we realized the tech was real. Not theoretical. Not "5 years away."

Real. Working. Now.
