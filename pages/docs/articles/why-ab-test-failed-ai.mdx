## The A/B Test That Made No Sense

**Week 0**: Offline testing shows 94% accuracy (beats baseline by 12pp)

**Week 2**: A/B test results
- **Treatment** (AI-powered): 58% task completion
- **Control** (manual): 64% task completion

**PM**: "The AI is more accurate. Why is adoption *worse*?"

**The Answer**: The AI works. The UX doesn't.

## The 5 Reasons A/B Tests Fail (Not Model Issues)

### Reason 1: Novelty Effect

**What Happens**: Users try new AI feature out of curiosity, then abandon it.

**Symptoms**:
- Week 1: Treatment adoption = 70%
- Week 4: Treatment adoption = 22%
- Control adoption: Flat at 60% (no novelty, consistent behavior)

**Diagnosis**: Plot adoption over time. If treatment starts high and declines, novelty effect.

**Fix**: Run A/B test for 4-6 weeks (not 2 weeks). Measure steady-state behavior, not initial curiosity.

### Reason 2: Selection Bias

**What Happens**: Early adopters aren't representative of average users.

**Symptoms**:
- Power users love AI feature (80% adoption)
- Average users ignore it (15% adoption)
- Overall A/B test: Treatment loses

**Diagnosis**: Segment results by user type (power user vs. casual). If power users win but average users lose, selection bias.

**Fix**: Either (a) target feature at power users only, or (b) improve UX for average users.

### Reason 3: Metric Mismatch

**What Happens**: You optimize for accuracy; users care about speed.

**Symptoms**:
- AI accuracy: 94% (treatment wins)
- Task completion time: 3 minutes (treatment) vs. 1 minute (control)
- Users prefer control (faster, even if less accurate)

**Diagnosis**: Check multiple metrics (accuracy, speed, satisfaction). If AI wins on accuracy but loses on speed, metric mismatch.

**Fix**: Either (a) make AI faster, or (b) communicate accuracy benefit to justify speed tradeoff.

### Reason 4: Trust Calibration Failure

**What Happens**: Users don't know when to trust AI, so they ignore it.

**Symptoms**:
- AI suggestion acceptance rate: 12%
- Manual override rate: 88%
- Users check AI, then do manual work anyway (double the effort)

**Diagnosis**: Interview users. If they say "I don't know if it's right," trust calibration issue.

**Fix**: Add confidence scores, show reasoning, provide examples of when AI is reliable.

### Reason 5: Integration Friction

**What Happens**: AI works, but workflow doesn't support it.

**Symptoms**:
- AI generates report, but user has to copy-paste into another tool
- Users say "It's easier to just do it manually"
- AI accuracy irrelevant if adoption is blocked by UX

**Diagnosis**: Watch users interact with feature (user testing). If they struggle with mechanics (not AI quality), integration friction.

**Fix**: Embed AI into existing workflow (don't force users to switch contexts).

## Real Example: Legal Research AI

**Feature**: AI suggests relevant case law for attorneys.

**Offline Metrics**: 92% precision, 89% recall (excellent)

**A/B Test (Week 2)**:
- **Treatment**: AI-powered case search
- **Control**: Manual Westlaw search
- **Result**: Control wins (attorneys prefer manual)

**Why?**

**User Interviews Revealed**:
1. **Trust Issue**: Attorneys didn't know when to trust AI suggestions (no confidence scores)
2. **Integration Friction**: AI opened in new tab; attorneys had to copy-paste citations into their brief
3. **Speed Issue**: AI took 10 seconds to load suggestions; manual search felt faster (even if less accurate)

**Fixes** (3 Weeks):
1. Added confidence scores (High/Medium/Low) + reasoning
2. Added "Insert into brief" button (one-click integration)
3. Pre-loaded AI suggestions in background (perceived speed: instant)

**Re-Test (Week 6)**:
- **Treatment (v2)**: 73% adoption
- **Control**: 58% adoption
- **Treatment wins** (same AI, better UX)

## The Diagnostic Checklist

Run this if your A/B test fails:

**Metric Analysis**:
- [ ] Check multiple metrics (adoption, accuracy, speed, satisfaction)
- [ ] Identify which metrics treatment wins vs. loses
- [ ] Confirm you're measuring what users actually care about

**User Segmentation**:
- [ ] Break down results by user type (power user, casual, new)
- [ ] Check if treatment wins for some segments but loses overall
- [ ] Consider targeting feature at winning segments only

**Temporal Analysis**:
- [ ] Plot adoption over time (Week 1, 2, 3, 4)
- [ ] Check for novelty effect (high initial adoption that drops)
- [ ] Run test for 4-6 weeks (not 2 weeks)

**Qualitative Research**:
- [ ] Interview 5 users from treatment group (why did you use/ignore AI?)
- [ ] Watch user sessions (where do they struggle?)
- [ ] Check support tickets (what complaints exist?)

**UX Audit**:
- [ ] Measure time-to-first-use (is AI discoverable?)
- [ ] Measure time-to-value (how long until AI provides useful output?)
- [ ] Check integration (does AI fit into existing workflow?)

## When the Model *Is* the Problem

**Symptom**: After fixing UX, adoption still low.

**Tests**:
- [ ] Check offline accuracy on production data (not just test set)
- [ ] Compare AI performance to user expectations (is 89% "good enough"?)
- [ ] Test on edge cases (does AI fail on hard examples users care about?)

**If Model Is the Problem**:
- Retrain on production data (test set may not represent real usage)
- Raise confidence threshold (only show high-confidence predictions)
- Add human-in-the-loop (AI suggests, human confirms)

## The Statistical Significance Trap

**Bad Conclusion**: "Treatment lost by 2pp. Kill the feature."

**Reality Check**:
- Sample size: 100 users
- Confidence interval: ±8pp
- **Not statistically significant** (could be noise)

**Good Conclusion**: "Inconclusive. Need 1,000+ users for significance."

**Rule**: Don't kill features based on underpowered A/B tests.

## Checklist: Before You Declare A/B Test a Failure

- [ ] Ran for 4+ weeks (not just 2)
- [ ] Sample size sufficient for statistical significance (use power calculator)
- [ ] Checked multiple metrics (not just primary KPI)
- [ ] Segmented by user type (power user vs. casual)
- [ ] Conducted user interviews (5+ users from treatment group)
- [ ] Audited UX (speed, integration, trust signals)
- [ ] Verified model accuracy on production data (not just test set)

**If you haven't done all of these, the test isn't conclusive.**
