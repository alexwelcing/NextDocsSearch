  Telling your CEO 'accuracy is 89%' isn't enough. They need to know: Is that
  89% ± 2pp or 89% ± 15pp? Here's how to communicate AI uncertainty to
  non-technical stakeholders.

## The Exec Question That Caught You Off-Guard

**CEO**: "You said the AI is 89% accurate. How confident are you in that number?"

**PM**: "Very confident. We tested it thoroughly."

**CEO**: "Okay, but is it 89% ± 1% or 89% ± 20%? Because if it's the latter, we could actually be at 69%, which changes everything."

**PM**: *Realizes they never calculated confidence intervals.*

**The Fix**: Always report AI metrics with confidence intervals.

## What Exec Teams Actually Need

**Bad Slide**:
```
AI Accuracy: 89%
```

**Good Slide**:
```
AI Accuracy: 89% (95% CI: 86-92%)

Translation: We're 95% confident the true accuracy is between 86% and 92%.
```

**Why This Matters**: The ±3pp range tells execs whether to trust the number or demand more testing.

## The Three Confidence Levels

### Narrow Confidence Interval (High Confidence)
```
Accuracy: 92% (95% CI: 91-93%)
Range: ±1pp
```

**What This Means**: We tested on 10,000+ examples. The number is rock-solid.

**Exec Decision**: Ship it. The uncertainty is negligible.

### Moderate Confidence Interval (Acceptable)
```
Accuracy: 89% (95% CI: 85-93%)
Range: ±4pp
```

**What This Means**: We tested on 500-1,000 examples. Some uncertainty, but tolerable.

**Exec Decision**: Ship with monitoring (track if production accuracy stays in range).

### Wide Confidence Interval (Red Flag)
```
Accuracy: 87% (95% CI: 72-95%)
Range: ±12pp
```

**What This Means**: We tested on under 100 examples. The number is unreliable.

**Exec Decision**: Don't ship. Get more test data first.

## Real Example: Healthcare Diagnostic AI

**Feature**: AI predicts patient diagnosis from symptoms.

**Initial Report** (Bad):
```
Accuracy: 91%
Test Set: 50 patients
```

**CEO's Question**: "Is 91% reliable enough to deploy?"

**PM's Honest Answer** (Good):
```
Accuracy: 91% (95% CI: 81-96%)

With only 50 patients, we're 95% confident the true accuracy is somewhere between 81% and 96%.

If true accuracy is 81%, we'd have 1 in 5 misdiagnoses—unacceptable for healthcare.

Recommendation: Test on 500+ patients to narrow confidence interval to ±3pp before launch.
```

**CEO's Decision**: "Get 500 patients. Then we'll revisit."

**Outcome**: After testing on 500 patients:
```
Accuracy: 88% (95% CI: 85-91%)
```

**CEO**: "88% with ±3pp uncertainty. That's a meaningful drop from 91%, but the narrow CI gives me confidence. Ship with physician review required."

## How to Calculate Confidence Intervals (For PMs)

**You Don't Need a PhD in Statistics. Use This Formula**:

```
For Binary Classification (Correct/Incorrect):

Confidence Interval = p ± 1.96 × sqrt(p × (1-p) / n)

Where:
- p = accuracy (e.g., 0.89 for 89%)
- n = test set size (e.g., 500)
- 1.96 = Z-score for 95% confidence
```

**Example**:
```
p = 0.89
n = 500

CI = 0.89 ± 1.96 × sqrt(0.89 × 0.11 / 500)
   = 0.89 ± 1.96 × 0.014
   = 0.89 ± 0.027
   = 0.86 to 0.92

Result: 89% (95% CI: 86-92%)
```

**Tool**: Use an online calculator (Google "confidence interval calculator") or ask your data scientist.

## The Sample Size Decision Tree

**Goal**: Achieve confidence interval of ±3pp or better.

**Required Sample Size**:
- For ±1pp: ~10,000 examples
- For ±2pp: ~2,500 examples
- For ±3pp: ~1,000 examples
- For ±5pp: ~400 examples

**Trade-Off**: More examples = narrower CI = more confidence, but more labeling cost.

**PM Decision**:
- High-stakes AI (healthcare, legal, finance): Target ±2pp (2,500+ examples)
- Medium-stakes AI (enterprise SaaS): Target ±3pp (1,000+ examples)
- Low-stakes AI (recommendations, search): Target ±5pp (400+ examples)

## When to Report Multiple Metrics with CIs

**Bad Report**:
```
Precision: 87%
Recall: 91%
F1: 0.89
```

**Good Report**:
```
Precision: 87% (95% CI: 84-90%)
Recall: 91% (95% CI: 88-94%)
F1: 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.92)
```

**Why**: Execs can now see that recall is more certain than precision (narrower CI on recall).

## The "Is This Good Enough?" Framework

**Exec asks**: "Is 89% accuracy good enough to ship?"

**PM's Answer** (With CI):
```
1. Accuracy: 89% (95% CI: 86-92%)
2. Worst-case scenario: 86% (lower bound of CI)
3. Baseline (manual process): 82%
4. Improvement: 86% - 82% = 4pp (even at worst case, we beat baseline)
5. Recommendation: Ship. Even if true accuracy is at lower bound, we're still better than status quo.
```

**Why This Works**: You've de-risked the decision by showing that even the pessimistic estimate wins.

## The Production Monitoring Strategy

**Pre-Launch CI**:
```
Accuracy: 89% (95% CI: 86-92%) on test set
```

**Post-Launch Monitoring**:
```
Week 1: 91% (95% CI: 89-93%) on production data
Week 4: 87% (95% CI: 85-89%)
Week 8: 84% (95% CI: 82-86%) ← Alert!
```

**Alert Trigger**: Production accuracy drops below lower bound of pre-launch CI (86%).

**Action**: Model is degrading. Retrain or rollback.

## Common PM Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Reporting Point Estimates Without Uncertainty**
- **Bad**: "Accuracy is 89%"
- **Good**: "Accuracy is 89% (95% CI: 86-92%)"

**Mistake 2: Testing on Too-Small Sample**
- **Reality**: 50 examples → ±14pp CI (useless)
- **Fix**: Budget for 1,000+ labeled examples

**Mistake 3: Ignoring CI Width When Making Go/No-Go Decisions**
- **Bad**: "89% beats our 85% target. Ship it."
- **Good**: "89% ± 12pp means we could be at 77%. Don't ship until CI narrows."

## The Exec-Friendly Slide Template

```
AI PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

Metric: Accuracy
Result: 89%
Confidence: 95% CI: 86-92%

Translation:
- We're 95% confident the true accuracy is between 86% and 92%
- Even at the low end (86%), we beat the manual baseline (82%)

Sample Size: 1,000 examples
Recommendation: Ship with post-launch monitoring

Risk: If production accuracy drops below 86%, we'll retrain or rollback.
```

**Time to Prepare This Slide**: 10 minutes (after you have the CI calculation).

**Time Saved in Exec Meetings**: 30 minutes of "But how confident are you?" back-and-forth.

## Checklist: Is Your AI Metric Report Exec-Ready?

- [ ] All metrics include 95% confidence intervals
- [ ] Sample size is documented (and sufficient for ±3pp CI)
- [ ] Worst-case scenario (lower CI bound) is still acceptable
- [ ] Comparison to baseline (manual process or previous model)
- [ ] Production monitoring plan (alert if accuracy exits CI range)
- [ ] Plain-English translation (no jargon like "p-value" or "Z-score")

**If any box is unchecked, your exec team will have follow-up questions.**
