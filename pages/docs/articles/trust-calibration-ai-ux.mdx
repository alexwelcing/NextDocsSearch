## The Feature That No One Uses

**Metrics After 3 Months**:
- AI accuracy: 92% (exceeds target)
- User adoption: 18% (misses target by 62pp)

**User interview #1**: "I don't trust it. What if it's wrong?"  
**User interview #2**: "I trust it completely. It's AI!"  
**User interview #3**: "I tried it once. It gave a weird answer. Never used it again."

**The diagnosis**: Not an accuracy problem. A **trust calibration problem**.

Your users don't know **when to trust the AI and when to double-check**. So they default to extremes: never trust, or always trust. Both kill adoption.

## The Trust Calibration Spectrum

```
Under-Reliance               Appropriate Reliance               Over-Reliance
(Zero Adoption)              (Goldilocks Zone)                   (Dangerous)
    ↓                               ↓                                  ↓
User ignores AI          User checks AI on hard          User blindly accepts
even when it's           cases, accepts on easy          all AI outputs,
correct                  cases                           including errors
```

**The Goal**: Design UX that pushes users toward **appropriate reliance**—trust when the AI is confident and correct, double-check when it's uncertain or error-prone.

## Why Trust Calibration Fails (Three Anti-Patterns)

### Anti-Pattern 1: No Confidence Signal

**Bad UX**:
```
AI Result: "The patient likely has Type 2 Diabetes."
[No indication of confidence]
```

**User Mental Model**: "Is this 60% confident or 99% confident? I have no idea. Better ignore it."

**Good UX**:
```
AI Result: "The patient likely has Type 2 Diabetes."
Confidence: High (94%)
Reasoning: Elevated HbA1c (7.2%), fasting glucose (140 mg/dL), BMI 32
```

**Why It Works**: User knows this is a high-confidence prediction. They can **trust without blind acceptance** (they see the reasoning).

### Anti-Pattern 2: Invisible Errors

**Bad UX**:
- AI makes mistake on edge case
- User discovers error during critical moment (e.g., client meeting)
- User loses trust permanently

**User Mental Model**: "It was wrong once. I can't trust it anymore."

**Good UX**:
- AI flags uncertain predictions: "Low Confidence (61%)—manual review recommended"
- User **expects** occasional low-confidence outputs
- Trust isn't binary (perfect or broken)—it's calibrated per prediction

**Why It Works**: Users develop mental model: "Green = trust, yellow = verify, red = don't use." They don't abandon the tool after one error.

### Anti-Pattern 3: No Feedback Loop

**Bad UX**:
- User corrects AI mistake
- AI doesn't learn
- Same mistake repeats

**User Mental Model**: "Why bother correcting it if nothing changes?"

**Good UX**:
- User marks AI output as incorrect
- System logs feedback: "Thanks! We'll improve this prediction type."
- Next week, similar case → AI gets it right
- User sees: "We improved accuracy on [case type] based on your feedback"

**Why It Works**: User feels **agency**. Trust isn't "take it or leave it"—it's a partnership.

## Real Example: Legal Research AI

**Feature**: AI suggests relevant case law for attorneys.

**Initial Design** (Under-Reliance):
- AI returns 20 cases
- No confidence scores
- No reasoning
- Attorneys ignore AI, manually search Westlaw (zero adoption)

**Redesign 1: Add Confidence**:
- AI returns 20 cases **with confidence scores** (High/Medium/Low)
- Attorneys trust High-confidence cases (75% adoption on those)
- Still ignore Medium/Low (overall adoption: 35%)

**Redesign 2: Show Reasoning**:
- High-confidence cases show **why** (keyword match, citation frequency, jurisdiction)
- Medium-confidence cases flag **risk**: "This case is from a different jurisdiction—verify applicability"
- Attorneys now use Medium-confidence cases as **research leads** (adoption: 62%)

**Redesign 3: Feedback Loop**:
- Attorneys mark cases as "relevant" or "not relevant"
- AI learns: "Cases from 9th Circuit often irrelevant for this attorney (practices in 2nd Circuit)"
- Precision improves from 68% → 79% over 3 months
- Adoption hits 81% (attorneys trust the AI because it **adapts to their practice**)

## The Confidence Display Framework

**Three Components** (show all three, or users won't calibrate):

### 1. Confidence Score
- **Numeric** (e.g., 87%) OR **Categorical** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Color-coded**: Green (High), Yellow (Medium), Red (Low)

### 2. Reasoning
- **Why** the AI is confident (or uncertain)
- **Key signals**: "Based on patient age (65), symptom duration (>3 months), lab results (HbA1c 7.2%)"
- **Missing info**: "Unable to assess cardiovascular risk—no cholesterol data"

### 3. Recommendation
- **High confidence**: "Accept this recommendation"
- **Medium confidence**: "Verify with [source]"
- **Low confidence**: "Manual review required—AI insufficient data"

## Designing for Over-Reliance (The Dangerous Case)

**Scenario**: Physician uses AI diagnostic tool. AI is 92% accurate. Physician **stops checking** the 8% of errors.

**Why Over-Reliance Happens**:
- AI is "usually right" → user develops **automation complacency**
- Checking takes time → user optimizes for speed, not accuracy
- Errors are rare → user forgets they exist

**How to Prevent**:

### 1. Force Interaction on Critical Decisions
- **Bad**: AI auto-fills diagnosis; physician clicks "Submit"
- **Good**: AI suggests diagnosis; physician must **type confirmation** ("I confirm Type 2 Diabetes")

**Why It Works**: Typing forces cognitive engagement. Physician re-reads AI output before confirming.

### 2. Randomized Human Review Prompts
- 10% of AI predictions (randomly selected) require human review **even if confidence is high**
- User must document: "I reviewed AI reasoning and agree" OR "I reviewed and disagree because..."

**Why It Works**: User can't develop "click-through" habit. Random checks keep cognitive engagement active.

### 3. Error Highlighting (Not Hiding)
- When AI makes mistake, **show the error prominently**: "Last week, AI misclassified 2 cases—here's what happened"
- Monthly summary: "AI accuracy this month: 91%. Errors: [list]"

**Why It Works**: Users maintain **healthy skepticism**. They don't forget the AI can fail.

## The "Goldilocks Zone" Checklist

Use this to audit your AI feature:

**Under-Reliance Prevention** (boost adoption):
- [ ] Confidence scores visible (High/Medium/Low or numeric)
- [ ] Reasoning shown (why AI is confident/uncertain)
- [ ] Success stories visible ("AI saved users X hours this month")
- [ ] Errors flagged proactively (don't let users discover them during critical moments)

**Over-Reliance Prevention** (reduce danger):
- [ ] Force interaction on critical decisions (no auto-accept)
- [ ] Randomized human review prompts (even on high-confidence outputs)
- [ ] Error transparency (show mistakes, don't hide them)
- [ ] Calibration training ("Here are 10 examples—which should you trust?")

**Feedback Loop** (improve over time):
- [ ] Users can mark AI outputs as correct/incorrect
- [ ] System logs feedback + re-trains periodically
- [ ] Users see improvements ("Accuracy on [case type] improved 8pp this quarter")

## When to Use Each Design Pattern

| User Behavior | Root Cause | Design Fix |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Never uses AI (under-reliance) | Doesn't know when to trust | Add confidence scores + reasoning |
| Blindly accepts all AI (over-reliance) | Automation complacency | Force interaction on critical decisions |
| Uses once, abandons (fragile trust) | One error → permanent distrust | Flag low-confidence predictions proactively |
| Uses AI but corrects errors (good!) | Wants partnership, not oracle | Add feedback loop + show improvements |

## The CHI Research That Validates This

**Human-AI Interaction studies (CHI, CSCW)** show:

1. **Confidence displays improve calibration** (users trust high-confidence outputs, verify low-confidence)
2. **Explanations reduce over-reliance** (users who see reasoning check AI outputs more)
3. **Error transparency increases long-term trust** (hiding errors → fragile trust; showing errors → resilient trust)

**PM Takeaway**: Trust calibration isn't a soft UX problem. It's an **engineering requirement**.

## Common PM Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Assuming "High Accuracy = High Adoption"**
- **Reality**: 92% accuracy with zero trust signals = 18% adoption
- **Fix**: Ship confidence scores + reasoning, not just accurate predictions

**Mistake 2: Hiding Errors**
- **Reality**: Users discover errors during critical moments → trust collapses
- **Fix**: Proactively flag uncertain predictions; errors become expected, not shocking

**Mistake 3: No Feedback Mechanism**
- **Reality**: Users correct AI mistakes but see no improvement → "Why bother?"
- **Fix**: Log corrections, retrain monthly, show users the impact of their feedback

## The Two-Week Trust Audit

**Week 1: Measure Current State**
- Log confidence scores for all AI predictions
- Track: How often do users accept high-confidence outputs? Low-confidence?
- Interview 5 users: "When do you trust the AI? When do you double-check?"

**Week 2: Implement Fixes**
- Add confidence display (High/Medium/Low)
- Show reasoning for top 3 predictions
- Add feedback button ("Mark as correct/incorrect")

**Month 3: Measure Impact**
- Adoption on high-confidence outputs: [target: >70%]
- Verification rate on low-confidence outputs: [target: >80%]
- Error discovery in critical moments: [target: near 0%]

**If trust calibration improves → adoption follows.**
