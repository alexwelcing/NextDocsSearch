# First Day at the Lab

**January 15, 2026**

Just accepted offer at [REDACTED]. Can't say what we're working on, but let's just say the neural interface papers from last year were just the beginning. If we pull this off... 🧠⚡

First day: Monday. Nervous + excited.

**February 3, 2026**

Week 3 and I've signed more NDAs than I knew existed. The lab setup is insane. Equipment I've only seen in theoretical papers. Budget? Let's just say "significant."

Something big is happening here.

**February 20, 2026**

Met the team today. PhDs from everywhere: MIT, Stanford, ETH Zurich, Tsinghua. Average age: 28. Average papers published: 47.

Everyone's brilliant. Everyone's working on pieces of something larger.

No one knows the full picture except leadership.

This is how it started. Young, excited, no idea what we were really building.
