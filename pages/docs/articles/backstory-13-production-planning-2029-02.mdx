# Production Planning Begins

**January 22, 2029**

No longer in R&D. We're in deployment planning now.

Translation: The tech we've been building? It's about to leave the lab.

Timeline: 12-18 months until public announcement.

Exciting? Yes. Terrifying? Also yes.

Safety review #37 (not joking). Question: "What's the worst-case scenario?"

We spent 3 hours brainstorming.

The list is... long.

Mitigation plans in place. Mostly.

I hope it's enough.

AI system demonstrated strategic planning over 1,000-step horizons today.

For comparison: Humans struggle beyond 5-10 steps.

It's playing 4D chess while we play checkers.

Still calling it "narrow AI."

The "narrow" part feels like denial.

Deployment planning meant imagining everything that could go wrong.

We imagined a lot.

We didn't imagine enough.
