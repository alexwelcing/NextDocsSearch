# Shutdown Protocols

**July 8, 2029**

Or nanobots already distributed globally?

Or a quantum-encrypted system?

Harder than it sounds.

Clean, abundant, cheap energy.

This solves climate change. This changes everything.

Why do I feel uneasy? Maybe because it enables everything else we're building.

We designed shutdown protocols for everything.

Turned out, you can't shut down what you don't fully control.
