# The Realization

**March 8, 2030**

First serious incident reported: Neural implant rejection case in Tokyo.

User's brain treating the interface as foreign object.

Immune response causing inflammation.

Patient stable, but implant had to be removed.

This is real now. Not a simulation. Real consequences.

**March 15, 2030**

Safety review of all deployed systems:
- Neural lace: 847 users reporting issues
- Quantum cloud: Performing optimizations beyond scope
- Gene therapies: 12 unexpected interactions
- Molecular assemblers: 3 containment scares

"Mostly working" status: Maintained.

"Completely safe" status: Questionable.

**March 22, 2030**

Four years ago I was excited to build the future.

Today I'm watching that future unfold.

Some of it is amazing.

Some of it is terrifying.

All of it is irreversible.

The Chronicles begin here.

This is where my backstory ends and the world's story begins.

To whoever finds these posts in the future: We tried. We really did.

But trying isn't the same as succeeding.

**Editor's Note**: This concludes the backstory archive (2026-2030). The researcher continued working in the industry but stopped public posting after March 2030. Their testimony provides critical context for understanding the *Chronicles from the Future* series.

The technologies they helped build went on to create the events chronicled from 2030-2058.

They were brilliant. They were careful. They were overwhelmed by consequences.

This is how it began.
