## The Partnership That Hit a Wall

**You**: "We'd like to use your de-identified patient dataset to train our diagnostic AI."

**Academic Medical Center**: "Great! Do you have an NIH-compliant Data Management and Sharing Plan?"

**You**: "A what?"

**AMC**: "NIH requires one for any research using federally-funded data. No plan, no data access. Sorry."

If you're building healthcare AI and using **NIH-funded datasets, academic partnerships, or public health data**—you're now subject to the NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy, effective January 2023.

This isn't theoretical. I've seen product roadmaps delayed 3-6 months because teams didn't know they needed DMS plans before accessing training data.

## What the NIH Policy Actually Requires

**Scope**: Any research funded by NIH (even partially) must have a Data Management and Sharing Plan.

**Who's Affected**:
- Academic researchers (obviously)
- Industry partners using NIH-funded datasets
- Startups collaborating with university hospitals
- Anyone training AI models on All of Us, ClinVar, dbGaP, or similar

**What You Need**:

### 1. Data Management Plan (DMP)
- **What data are you collecting/using?** (type, volume, format)
- **Where will you store it?** (cloud provider, encryption, access controls)
- **How will you preserve it?** (retention period, versioning, backups)

### 2. Data Sharing Plan (DSP)
- **What will you share?** (raw data, processed data, model outputs)
- **When will you share it?** (immediately, after publication, never)
- **Where will you deposit it?** (repository: Zenodo, Dryad, institutional repo)
- **Who can access it?** (public, researchers only, controlled-access)

**PM Translation**: You can't just train a model on NIH data and walk away. You must document **data provenance, storage, and sharing commitments**—or lose access.

## The Three Sharing Tiers

NIH allows flexibility based on sensitivity:

### Tier 1: No Sharing (Rare)
- **When**: Data contains identifiable patient info (HIPAA violations if shared)
- **Justification Required**: Must explain why sharing is impossible
- **Example**: Clinical notes with names/dates still visible

**PM Takeaway**: If your data is this sensitive, you won't get NIH funding. De-identify first.

### Tier 2: Controlled Access (Common for Healthcare AI)
- **When**: Data is de-identified but still sensitive (genomics, rare diseases)
- **Repository**: dbGaP, controlled-access institutional repo
- **Access Process**: Researchers request access, IRB/DAC approves

**PM Takeaway**: You can use this data, but you must commit to depositing your **processed datasets and model outputs** in a controlled-access repo within 12 months of publication.

### Tier 3: Open Access (Best for Collaboration)
- **When**: Data is fully de-identified, low re-identification risk
- **Repository**: Zenodo, Dryad, GitHub (with DOI)
- **Access Process**: Anyone can download

**PM Takeaway**: If you can anonymize enough to go open-access, you maximize citations and research impact. But healthcare data rarely qualifies.

## Real Example: Diagnostic AI for Rare Disease

**Project**: Train AI to detect rare genetic disorder from patient imaging + genomics.

**Data Sources**:
- 5,000 de-identified MRI scans (from NIH-funded biobank)
- 5,000 genomic sequences (from dbGaP, controlled-access)

### Step 1: Write Data Management Plan

**What data are you using?**
- MRI scans: 5,000 DICOM files, 2TB total
- Genomics: 5,000 VCF files, 500GB total
- Annotations: Expert labels (disease/no disease) for each patient

**Where will you store it?**
- AWS S3 (encrypted at rest, AES-256)
- Access controls: PM, 3 data scientists, 2 clinical collaborators (7 people total)
- No data leaves secure environment (no local downloads)

**How will you preserve it?**
- Retention: 7 years post-publication (NIH minimum)
- Versioning: Dataset v1.0 (initial), v1.1 (added 500 cases), v2.0 (re-labeled)
- Backups: Daily snapshots to separate S3 bucket (different region)

### Step 2: Write Data Sharing Plan

**What will you share?**
- **Raw data**: NO (still contains quasi-identifiers like rare mutation patterns)
- **Processed features**: YES (aggregated imaging features, not full scans)
- **Model weights**: YES (trained model for reproducibility)
- **Evaluation code**: YES (GitHub repo, open-access)

**When will you share?**
- Upon publication (estimated 18 months from project start)
- Model weights embargoed for 6 months (commercial advantage)

**Where will you deposit?**
- Processed features: dbGaP (controlled-access, researchers request approval)
- Model weights: Zenodo (open-access after embargo)
- Code: GitHub (open-access immediately)

**Who can access?**
- Controlled-access: Researchers with IRB approval + data use agreement
- Open-access: Anyone (code, model after embargo)

### Step 3: Get Approval

- Submit DMS plan to NIH (part of grant application or partnership agreement)
- IRB reviews data use (confirms HIPAA compliance)
- Data Access Committee (DAC) approves access to dbGaP genomics

**Timeline**: 2 months from "we want the data" to "we have access."

**What Happens If We Skip This?**
- NIH revokes data access
- Academic partner terminates collaboration
- Can't publish in NIH-funded journals (no DMS plan = desk rejection)

## The "We're a Startup, Not Academics" Trap

**You Might Think**: "We're not applying for NIH grants. This doesn't apply."

**You're Still In Scope If**:
- You partner with a university hospital (they have NIH funding)
- You use public datasets like All of Us, ClinVar, dbGaP (all NIH-funded)
- You hire postdocs or researchers who brought NIH data with them
- You publish in journals that require NIH compliance (JAMA, NEJM, Nature Medicine)

**The Policy Follows the Data, Not the Funding.**

If the dataset was created with NIH money, you must comply—even if you're a for-profit company.

Use this for your next academic partnership:

```
DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN

1. Data Type and Volume
- [X] imaging scans, [Y] genomic sequences, [Z] clinical annotations
- Total size: [N] TB
- Format: DICOM, VCF, CSV

2. Storage and Security
- Platform: AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage / Azure Blob
- Encryption: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- Access Controls: Role-based (PM, data scientists, clinical collaborators)
- Audit Logs: All access logged, reviewed monthly

3. Preservation
- Retention Period: 7 years post-publication (NIH minimum)
- Versioning: Dataset v1.0 (initial), v1.x (minor updates), v2.0 (breaking changes)
- Backups: Daily snapshots, 30-day retention, separate geographic region

DATA SHARING PLAN

1. What Will Be Shared
- [ ] Raw data (if de-identified and low re-identification risk)
- [x] Processed features (aggregated, anonymized)
- [x] Model weights (for reproducibility)
- [x] Code (GitHub, Apache 2.0 license)

2. Sharing Timeline
- Upon publication OR within 12 months of project completion
- Embargo period (if applicable): [N] months for competitive advantage

3. Repository
- Controlled-Access: dbGaP, ICPSR, institutional repository
- Open-Access: Zenodo, Dryad, GitHub (with DOI)

4. Access Conditions
- Controlled-Access: Requires IRB approval + Data Use Agreement
- Open-Access: CC BY 4.0 license (attribution required)

5. Non-Sharing Justification (if applicable)
- Data contains identifiable info → HIPAA prohibits sharing
- Commercial IP → Sharing model architecture but not proprietary training process
```

## Checklist: Before Requesting NIH-Funded Data

- [ ] Confirm data source has NIH funding (check dataset documentation)
- [ ] Write Data Management Plan (storage, security, retention)
- [ ] Write Data Sharing Plan (what, when, where, who)
- [ ] Get IRB approval (if using patient data)
- [ ] Sign Data Use Agreement with data provider
- [ ] Identify repository for depositing outputs (dbGaP, Zenodo, etc.)
- [ ] Set calendar reminder: share data within 12 months of publication
- [ ] Budget for long-term storage (7 years × data size × cloud costs)

## Why This Matters Beyond Compliance

**Strategic Benefit 1: Academic Partnerships**
- Universities won't collaborate without DMS plans
- Having one ready accelerates partnerships from 6 months → 2 months

**Strategic Benefit 2: Reproducibility**
- Sharing code + model weights = more citations
- Other researchers validate your work = stronger evidence for product claims

**Strategic Benefit 3: Regulatory Trust**
- FDA increasingly asks: "Can you reproduce your training results?"
- DMS plan = yes, here's the versioned dataset, code, and evaluation protocol

**Strategic Benefit 4: IP Protection**
- Controlled-access sharing protects competitive advantage
- You share enough for reproducibility, not enough for competitors to clone

## Common PM Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Assuming "De-identified" = "Can Share Freely"**
- **Reality**: De-identified ≠ anonymous. Rare diseases, genomics, and imaging can still re-identify patients.
- **Fix**: Use controlled-access repositories (dbGaP, not GitHub).

**Mistake 2: Not Budgeting for Storage Costs**
- **Reality**: 7 years × 2TB × $0.023/GB/month (S3) = $3,900. Plus egress fees.
- **Fix**: Include long-term storage in project budget.

**Mistake 3: Waiting Until Publication to Write DMS Plan**
- **Reality**: NIH requires plan **before** data access. Retroactive plans get rejected.
- **Fix**: Write DMS plan as part of partnership agreement, not post-hoc.

## The 10-Year Horizon

**Coming Soon**:
- **NIH AI/ML Supplement** (rumored 2025-2026): Specific requirements for model sharing, adversarial testing, bias audits
- **Medicare/Medicaid Alignment**: CMS may require NIH-style DMS plans for AI reimbursement
- **FDA PreCert**: Digital health companies may need DMS plans for regulatory approval

**If you build healthcare AI, treat NIH compliance as table stakes—not a nice-to-have.**
