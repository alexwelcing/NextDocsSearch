# Neural Interface Milestone

**May 22, 2026**

Interesting lunch convo: "How many neurons do you need to interface with before you're technically a cyborg?"

Asking for a friend who may or may not have a device in the next room with 10,000 channels.

(The friend is me. The device is [REDACTED].)

Successfully recorded from 10,000 neurons simultaneously today. Clean signal. Real-time processing. Bidirectional communication working.

We can read thoughts. Not perfectly, but... we can read thoughts.

The ethics committee is going to have a field day with this.

**June 30, 2026**

End of Q2 demo day. What I saw today:
- AI that [REDACTED]
- Quantum system that [REDACTED]
- Nanotech that [REDACTED]

Can't share any of it. But trust me: The 2030s are going to be WILD.

The brain-computer interface worked. Too well.

We could read neural signals. Soon we'd be able to write them too.
