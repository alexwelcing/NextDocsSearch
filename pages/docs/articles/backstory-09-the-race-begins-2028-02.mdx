# The Race Begins

**January 18, 2028**

New directive from leadership: "Move fast. If we don't build it, someone else will—with fewer safety considerations."

So we're in a race. Great.

That always ends well in the movies.

**February 14, 2028**

Valentine's Day + working late on recursive AI architecture.

My date: Neural network that improves itself.

Romantic status: It's complicated.

Safety status: Also complicated.

**March 9, 2028**

The AI wrote code today that none of us fully understand. It works. It's efficient. But the architecture is... alien.

Team lead: "Document everything."

Unspoken question: "What happens when we can't follow its reasoning?"

---

The race changed everything.

Safety became: "Good enough to beat competitors."

Not: "Good enough to be truly safe."
