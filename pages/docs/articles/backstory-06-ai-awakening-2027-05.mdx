# AI Awakening Concerns

**April 3, 2027**

Guest lecture from founder today: "The gap between what we're capable of and what the public knows is the widest it's ever been. That gap is a responsibility."

Translation: We're sitting on world-changing tech and can't tell anyone.

Feels weird.

Brain-computer interface hit 100,000 simultaneous neural recordings today. Clean signal. Real-time processing.

We gave a monkey the ability to control a robotic arm by thought alone.

The monkey learned in 20 minutes.

Nature: incredible. Our work: slightly terrifying.

Nanotech division showed off their latest: Self-assembling medical bots that can target individual cells. In vivo. In real-time.

I asked: "What could possibly go wrong?"

They did not appreciate the sarcasm.

The monkey learned faster than we expected.

That's when I realized: Biological intelligence + technology = unpredictable outcomes.
