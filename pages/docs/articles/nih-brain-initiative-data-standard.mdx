## The Academic Partnership That Hit a Data Wall

**Neuroscience Lab**: "We'd like to train your AI on our fMRI and electrophysiology datasets."

**PM**: "Great! Send us the data."

**Lab**: "It's in BIDS format with NWB metadata. Can you ingest that?"

**PM**: "What's BIDS? We use CSV."

**Lab**: "NIH BRAIN Initiative requires BIDS. No exceptions. If you can't handle it, we can't collaborate."

**PM**: *Googles "BIDS" and discovers a 6-month integration project.*

## What NIH BRAIN Initiative Requires

**Scope**: Any research funded by NIH BRAIN Initiative (launched 2014, now $400M+/year) must follow data sharing standards.

**Who's Affected**:
- Academic neuroscience labs (obviously)
- AI startups collaborating with universities
- Companies training models on brain imaging, neural recordings, or behavioral data

**The Standards**:

### 1. BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)
**What**: Standardized folder/file naming for neuroimaging data (fMRI, EEG, MEG)

**Example**:
```
dataset/
  sub-01/
    anat/
      sub-01_T1w.nii.gz       # Anatomical MRI scan
    func/
      sub-01_task-memory_bold.nii.gz  # Functional MRI
  participants.tsv             # Metadata (age, sex, diagnosis)
```

**Why This Matters**: If your AI expects `patient_123_scan.nii`, but data comes in BIDS format, you'll need a conversion pipeline.

### 2. NWB (Neurodata Without Borders)
**What**: HDF5-based format for electrophysiology, optogenetics, and behavioral data

**Example**: Neural spike times, LFP recordings, behavioral timestamps

**Why This Matters**: Raw CSV files won't cut it. NWB includes rich metadata (electrode coordinates, recording device, experiment protocol).

### 3. DANDI Archive
**What**: NIH-funded data repository for BRAIN Initiative datasets

**Requirement**: Funded researchers must deposit data in DANDI within 12 months of publication

**Why This Matters**: If you partner with a BRAIN-funded lab, they'll eventually publish the data you trained on. Your model card must reference the DANDI deposit.

## Real Example: Seizure Prediction AI

**Project**: Train AI to predict epileptic seizures from EEG data.

**Data Source**: NIH BRAIN-funded lab at major university.

**Step 1: Understand the Data Format**

**Lab provides**:
- 50 patients × 24-hour EEG recordings
- BIDS format: `sub-01_task-rest_eeg.edf`
- Metadata: `participants.tsv` (age, sex, seizure frequency)

**Our pipeline expects**:
- CSV files: `patient_id, timestamp, eeg_channel_1, ..., eeg_channel_32`

**Gap**: Need BIDS → CSV converter.

**Solution**: Use MNE-Python (open-source library) to read BIDS-formatted EEG and export to CSV.

```python
import mne
from mne_bids import BIDSPath, read_raw_bids

# Read BIDS-formatted EEG
bids_path = BIDSPath(subject='01', task='rest', datatype='eeg', root='dataset/')
raw = read_raw_bids(bids_path)

# Export to CSV
df = raw.to_data_frame()
df.to_csv('sub-01_eeg.csv')
```

**Time Investment**: 2 days to write converter, 1 day to test on all 50 patients.

**Step 2: Document Data Provenance**

**Model Card Requirement**: Where did training data come from?

**Our Answer**:
- **Source**: NIH BRAIN Initiative grant R01-NS123456 (PI: Dr. Smith, University X)
- **Format**: BIDS-compliant EEG (50 subjects, 24-hour recordings)
- **Metadata**: Age 18-65, diagnosed epilepsy, seizure frequency 1-10/month
- **Repository**: Data will be deposited in DANDI Archive (DOI pending, post-publication)

**Why This Matters**: Auditors will ask, "Can you reproduce your training results?" If data is in DANDI, answer is "Yes—here's the DOI."

**Step 3: Comply with Data Sharing Plan**

**NIH Requirement**: If we publish using this data, we must share our processed datasets.

**What We Share**:
- **Raw data**: No (already in DANDI from lab)
- **Processed features**: Yes (seizure annotations, spectral features)
- **Model weights**: Yes (trained model for reproducibility)
- **Code**: Yes (GitHub repo, Apache 2.0 license)

**Where We Share**:
- Processed features → DANDI (controlled-access)
- Model weights → Zenodo (open-access)
- Code → GitHub (open-access)

**Timeline**: Within 12 months of publication (NIH policy).

## The BIDS Conversion Checklist

If you're integrating BIDS data:

- [ ] Install MNE-Python or PyBIDS (Python libraries for BIDS)
- [ ] Identify data types in dataset (fMRI, EEG, MEG, behavioral)
- [ ] Write conversion script (BIDS → your internal format)
- [ ] Validate: Check that subject IDs, timestamps, channels align
- [ ] Document mapping (which BIDS fields map to your schema)
- [ ] Test on 5 subjects before running on full dataset

**Common Pitfall**: BIDS uses `sub-01` (zero-padded), but your pipeline expects `patient_1`. Mismatch causes data loss.

## The NWB Integration Challenge

**Problem**: NWB files are HDF5 (binary), not CSV (text).

**Solution**: Use PyNWB library.

```python
from pynwb import NWBHDF5IO

# Read NWB file
io = NWBHDF5IO('sub-01_ephys.nwb', 'r')
nwbfile = io.read()

# Extract spike times
units = nwbfile.units
spike_times = units['spike_times'][0]  # First neuron

# Extract behavioral data
behavior = nwbfile.processing['behavior']['position']
```

**Time Investment**: 3-5 days to learn PyNWB, write extraction code, test.

**When to Use**: If your AI needs electrophysiology data (spike trains, LFP, calcium imaging).

## When You DON'T Need BIDS/NWB

**Exemptions**:
- You're not using NIH BRAIN-funded data
- You're using commercial datasets (not academic collaborations)
- Your AI doesn't use neuroimaging or electrophysiology (e.g., clinical notes AI)

**But**: If you ever plan to publish in neuroscience journals, BIDS is becoming the de facto standard. Supporting it future-proofs your pipeline.

## The DANDI Archive Strategy

**What to Deposit**:
- Processed datasets (with annotations, labels, derived features)
- Code (data processing scripts, training code)
- Model weights (for reproducibility)

**What Not to Deposit**:
- Raw data (if it's already in DANDI from the original lab)
- Proprietary algorithms (if you're commercializing)

**Access Control**:
- **Open Access**: If data is fully de-identified, low re-identification risk
- **Controlled Access**: If data contains sensitive info (rare disease, genomics)

**Timeline**: Deposit within 12 months of publication (NIH policy).

## Checklist: Are You BRAIN Initiative Compliant?

- [ ] Data is BIDS-formatted (or you have a conversion pipeline)
- [ ] Metadata is complete (participants.tsv with demographics)
- [ ] NWB integration (if using electrophysiology)
- [ ] Data provenance documented (grant number, PI, institution)
- [ ] Data sharing plan written (what, when, where)
- [ ] DANDI deposit scheduled (within 12 months of publication)
- [ ] Code and model weights ready to share (GitHub + Zenodo)

**If any box is unchecked and you're using BRAIN data, you have gaps.**

## Common PM Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Assuming CSV is Universal**
- **Reality**: Neuroscience uses BIDS (neuroimaging) and NWB (electrophysiology), not CSV
- **Fix**: Budget 1-2 weeks for data format integration

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Data Sharing Requirements**
- **Reality**: NIH requires sharing within 12 months of publication
- **Fix**: Write Data Management Plan before requesting data (not after publication)

**Mistake 3: Not Crediting the Original Dataset**
- **Reality**: BRAIN datasets have DOIs, PIs, and grant numbers—cite them
- **Fix**: Include full citation in model card and publications
