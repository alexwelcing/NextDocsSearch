A huge round of applause for all of the teams, industry and internal, who spent time to share learnings and show examples of the new possible. Months of planning go into each presentation to provide the most value possible to attending cloud practitioners.

The polished on-stage demos and talks we see from Google Developer Advocates, Client CIOs, Startup Architects, and Enterprise Marketers happen with the support of a massive event team. These teams produce content, improve attendee experience, and support a growing partner ecosystem.

As we review innovations in automation and what machines have learned, remember, the cloud is made by people. Don't mistake solutions that increase the productivity of people for systems that will replace them.

With that being said, here is my Playlist with 40+ sessions highlighted.

## 100% Prediction Accuracy for Next '23

### ✅ Data for AI

Whether you want to talk about BigQuery, AlloyDB, or AI-enabled database migration, the data track featured several major shakeups, sometimes drawing competitive lines in the sand like with Database Migration Services. Find that [Deck here](https://assets.swoogo.com/uploads/2858382-64f0c7eca43c9.pdf) and watch the 'What's Next for Google Cloud databases' presentation:

If you haven't already adopted BigQuery for your business, now is a great time to start. Discover what is possible with BigQuery's ML inference engine, which is now in GA: [BigQuery ML inference engine](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bigquery-ml-inference-engine-is-now-ga)

### ✅ Cybersecurity

When Google acquired [Mandiant](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/12/google-closes-5-4b-mandiant-acquisition/) last year for $5 billion, GCP customers received a boost in their own security positioning. The benefits of this acquisition, and Google's commitment to secure software supply chain, were highlighted throughout Next's Keynote and Security tracks. Understanding enterprise decision making and priorities, especially when making long-term IT investment, Google Cloud emphasized:

_No mission is more important than your security mission._

This is not an attack on MLOps, but a reality for enterprises embracing innovation. Building an innovative feedback loop that can harness local embedded context for accurate real-time decision making while also processing transaction data for future model training does happen without securing our P.O.S., network, and data.

Accenture Security made the most of their partner presence at Next by emphasizing their ability to facilitate innovation with Google's 'secure by design, secure by default' infrastructure. Regulated industries like Banking, Healthcare, and Telecommunications seeking to capitalize on Gen AI should consider embarking on the journey with a trusted partner.

### ✅ Generative AI

This wasn't a hard guess, especially if you noticed the navigation menu for the event. Before I claim too much credit for technical insight, I should mention that several key topics at Google Cloud Next were discussed during March's Startup Leaders Forum at Pier 57. This included Gen AI and Analytics improvements.

![Google Cloud Startup Leaders Forum](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E12AQGe13P0zxwzpQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1693930560404?e=1699488000&v=beta&t=MEWiRuNq_AHLEc9qP-Rke5Oax1_q_-zW6fC4jFnh-YM)

Since March, key model features and systems integrations have progressed from Preview into GA, specifically with regards to BigQuery and Duet AI integration across GCP.

I'll be testing Duet AI and Vertex AI capabilities over the coming months and sharing my results, but offices already running Workspace should be excited by the upcoming rollout and identify users that will be eager to get value out of a $30/month assistant capable of:

- Google Meet real-time speaker notes
- Translated captions
- Interactive "Catch Me Up" if you arrive late to a meeting in progress

Duet shines best by integrating with your existing work and accelerating your ability to create and present. Just watch Aparna Pappu and Tony DeVincenzi demonstrate a completely new client presentation come to life in seconds based on user instructions and existing documents. Jump to 52-minute mark for Duet AI features.

I have heard CEOs and admins express reservations about the $30/mo pricing and expect that there may be opportunities for early adopter negotiation and consideration, but the value offering is clear in two separate directions.

- Professionals who adapt to using AI assistants will increase their output and work-life balance. An organizational strategy for AI will attract talent, while a laggard position can deter candidates.
- If you don't provide it, someone else will. With Vertex and Duet inside GCP, organizations have the opportunity to enable secure collaborative creativity. Using different vendors increases attack vectors and decreases interoperability. Organizations are consolidating software vendors and are aware of the pricing advantages to negotiate 3-year deals.

## Final Thoughts

Another year, another successful event by Google Cloud. The innovations presented will no doubt revolutionize the way businesses work and improve productivity. From the improvements to BigQuery to the potential of Duet AI, there's a lot to look forward to.

As always, I appreciate the opportunity to connect with fellow cloud practitioners and leaders. Here's to a successful implementation of what we've learned and to an even more insightful event next year. Cheers!
