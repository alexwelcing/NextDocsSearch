# Year Two Reflections

**November 25, 2027**

Thanksgiving reflection: Grateful for this opportunity. Grateful for brilliant colleagues. Grateful for cutting-edge work.

Also: Slightly terrified we're moving too fast.

Also also: Can't slow down. Competition is fierce.

What could go wrong? 🙃

Year Two: We moved faster than ever.

The question "should we?" became "can we beat the competition?"

Different question. Different answer.
