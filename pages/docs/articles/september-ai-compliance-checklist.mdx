## The October Email You Don't Want

**Subject**: SOC2 Audit Kickoff — Nov 1

**Auditor**: "We'll need documentation for all AI/ML systems deployed in 2025. Please provide by Oct 25:
- Model cards with training data provenance
- Risk registers with mitigation evidence
- Incident response logs
- Access control policies
- Data retention schedules"

**You** (PM, realizing none of this exists): "I'll… get back to you."

**September is AI compliance prep month.** If you ship AI features in regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal, enterprise SaaS), Q4 audits are coming. The companies that pass on the first try? They spent September building the artifacts.

## Why September (The Audit Calendar)

**October-December**: Peak audit season
- SOC2 Type II (annual audits for SaaS companies)
- HIPAA compliance reviews (healthcare)
- ISO 27001 renewals (enterprise security)
- Year-end risk committee reviews

**September**: Last chance to fix gaps before auditors arrive.

**What Happens If You're Not Ready**:
- Audit findings (non-conformities) → delayed certification
- Customer trust erosion (SOC2 report has "exceptions")
- Contract renewals blocked (enterprise buyers demand clean audits)
- Remediation scramble (team drops roadmap work to fix gaps)

**What Happens If You Are Ready**:
- Clean audit (zero findings)
- Faster enterprise sales (SOC2 report is a competitive advantage)
- Team focus (no Q4 fire drills)

## The 30-Day Checklist (Week-by-Week)

### Week 1 (Sep 1-7): Inventory Your AI Features

**Goal**: Know what you shipped this year.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] List all AI/ML features in production (name, launch date, user-facing or internal)
- [ ] Identify high-risk features (healthcare data, PII, automated decisions affecting users)
- [ ] Tag features by compliance scope (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR, EU AI Act)
- [ ] Assign DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for each feature

**Template**:
| Feature | Launch Date | Risk Level | Compliance Scope | DRI |
|---------|-------------|------------|------------------|-----|
| AI email suggestions | Jan 2025 | Medium | SOC2 | PM: Sarah |
| Patient diagnosis assistant | Mar 2025 | High | HIPAA, SOC2 | PM: Alex |
| Resume screening | Jun 2025 | High | GDPR, EU AI Act | PM: Jordan |

**Why This Matters**: Auditors will ask, "Show me all AI systems." If you say "I don't know," audit fails immediately.

### Week 2 (Sep 8-14): Build Model Cards

**Goal**: Document what the AI does, how it was trained, and what risks exist.

**Tasks** (per AI feature):
- [ ] Create model card (model architecture, training data, eval metrics)
- [ ] Document data provenance (where training data came from, dates, sampling method)
- [ ] List known limitations (edge cases, bias risks, accuracy boundaries)
- [ ] Define human oversight plan (who reviews AI outputs, when, how to override)

**Model Card Template**:
```
MODEL CARD: [Feature Name]

1. MODEL DETAILS
- Architecture: [e.g., Fine-tuned GPT-4, BERT classifier, XGBoost]
- Version: [e.g., v2.3, deployed Aug 15, 2025]
- Training Date: [e.g., Aug 1-10, 2025]
- Compute: [e.g., 8 A100 GPUs, 24 hours]

2. INTENDED USE
- Primary Use Case: [e.g., Suggest email responses for support tickets]
- Users: [e.g., Customer support team, 50 agents]
- Out-of-Scope Uses: [e.g., Not for legal advice, medical diagnosis]

3. TRAINING DATA
- Source: [e.g., Internal support ticket database, 2020-2024]
- Volume: [e.g., 500,000 tickets, 2M tokens]
- Sampling: [e.g., Random sample, stratified by ticket category]
- Preprocessing: [e.g., De-identified PII, removed spam tickets]
- Bias Risks: [e.g., Overrepresents US English, underrepresents non-English]

4. EVALUATION
- Metrics: [e.g., Accuracy 89%, F1 0.87, Precision 0.85, Recall 0.90]
- Test Set: [e.g., 10,000 held-out tickets, same time range]
- Fairness Testing: [e.g., Demographic parity within 5pp across user segments]

5. LIMITATIONS
- Edge Cases: [e.g., Struggles with sarcasm, multi-language tickets]
- Known Failures: [e.g., 8% false positive rate on urgent tickets]
- Not Suitable For: [e.g., Legal/medical content, customer complaints]

6. HUMAN OVERSIGHT
- Review Process: [e.g., Agent reviews all AI suggestions before sending]
- Override Rate: [e.g., 15% of suggestions modified or rejected]
- Escalation: [e.g., Agents flag bad suggestions → PM reviews weekly]
```

**Time Investment**: 2-4 hours per feature.

**Why This Matters**: SOC2 and HIPAA auditors will ask, "How do you ensure AI quality?" Model card = your answer.

### Week 3 (Sep 15-21): Document Risk Registers

**Goal**: Prove you've identified risks and mitigated them.

**Tasks** (per AI feature):
- [ ] Create risk register (failure modes, likelihood, impact, mitigation)
- [ ] Document testing evidence (adversarial testing, bias audits, edge case eval)
- [ ] Log incidents (if AI failed, what happened, how you fixed it)
- [ ] Define monitoring plan (what metrics track post-launch, alert thresholds)

**Risk Register Template**:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Evidence | Status |
|------|------------|--------|------------|----------|--------|
| AI hallucinates citation | High | High | Human review required; citation validator | Eval report (95% accuracy) | Mitigated |
| Bias against non-English speakers | Medium | Medium | Demographic parity testing; quarterly audit | Fairness audit (within 5pp) | Mitigated |
| Data leak (PII in training set) | Low | Critical | De-identification pipeline; access controls | Penetration test (passed) | Mitigated |
| Model degrades over time | Medium | Medium | Monthly accuracy tracking; auto-alert if under 85% | Monitoring dashboard (live) | Active |

**Time Investment**: 3-5 hours per feature.

**Why This Matters**: Auditors will ask, "What could go wrong?" Risk register = proof you thought about it (and fixed it).

### Week 4 (Sep 22-30): Audit Prep Dry Run

**Goal**: Simulate the audit. Find gaps before the auditor does.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review all model cards + risk registers (are they complete?)
- [ ] Check access controls (who can modify AI models? logs exist?)
- [ ] Verify data retention (are training datasets backed up per policy?)
- [ ] Test incident response (can you disable AI feature in under 5 minutes?)
- [ ] Collect evidence (screenshots, logs, test results)
- [ ] Identify gaps (missing docs, untested controls, incomplete logs)

**Dry Run Checklist**:
- [ ] Can you show model card for every AI feature?
- [ ] Can you show risk register with mitigation evidence?
- [ ] Can you show human oversight plan (who reviews, when, how)?
- [ ] Can you show incident response plan (kill switch, escalation, RCA process)?
- [ ] Can you show monitoring dashboard (accuracy, error rate, user feedback)?
- [ ] Can you show access logs (who accessed training data, when)?
- [ ] Can you show data retention schedule (how long you keep data, why)?

**If any answer is "no," you have gaps. Fix them before Oct 1.**

## The Five Audit Questions (And How to Answer Them)

### Q1: "How do you ensure AI quality?"
**Bad Answer**: "We test the model before launch."

**Good Answer**: "We use a three-layer eval process:
1. **Offline**: Locked eval set (1,000 examples), quarterly re-eval
2. **Online**: A/B test (2-week pilot, 10% of users)
3. **Monitoring**: Real-time accuracy tracking, alert if under 85%

Evidence: Eval reports, A/B test results, monitoring dashboard screenshots."

### Q2: "What happens if the AI fails?"
**Bad Answer**: "We'd fix it."

**Good Answer**: "We have a documented incident response plan:
1. **Kill switch**: Feature flag, under 2 minute response time
2. **Escalation**: PM paged, reviews within 1 hour
3. **Root cause**: Post-mortem within 48 hours

Evidence: Runbook (link), feature flag screenshot, past incident post-mortem (if applicable)."

### Q3: "How do you prevent bias?"
**Bad Answer**: "We use diverse training data."

**Good Answer**: "We test for demographic parity across user segments:
- **Metric**: Acceptance rate within 5pp across gender/race/age
- **Frequency**: Quarterly fairness audit
- **Action**: If parity violated, retrain with balanced sampling

Evidence: Fairness audit report (latest: Aug 2025), demographic parity test results."

### Q4: "Who can access AI training data?"
**Bad Answer**: "Our data science team."

**Good Answer**: "Access is role-based with audit logs:
- **Approved roles**: PM, ML engineer, data scientist (7 people)
- **Access process**: Request → manager approval → log entry
- **Audit**: Monthly review of access logs by security team

Evidence: Access control policy (doc link), access log export (last 90 days)."

### Q5: "How do you handle user data in AI?"
**Bad Answer**: "We de-identify it."

**Good Answer**: "We follow a documented data lifecycle:
1. **Collection**: User consent (privacy policy, opt-in)
2. **Processing**: De-identification (remove PII, hash IDs)
3. **Retention**: 7 years for training data, 90 days for logs
4. **Deletion**: Automated purge after retention period

Evidence: Privacy policy (link), de-identification code (GitHub), retention schedule (table), deletion job logs (cron output)."

## Real Example: Healthcare AI Feature (HIPAA Audit)

**Feature**: AI-generated patient summaries for physicians.

**Audit Date**: Nov 15, 2025

**September Prep**:

**Week 1**: Inventoried feature (high-risk, HIPAA scope, DRI: PM Alex)

**Week 2**: Built model card
- Training data: 10,000 de-identified patient notes (2020-2024)
- Eval: 89% physician agreement, tested on 200 notes
- Limitations: Struggles with rare diseases, multi-comorbidity cases

**Week 3**: Documented risk register
- Risk: PHI leak in training set → Mitigation: De-identification pipeline, passed penetration test
- Risk: Inaccurate summary → Mitigation: Physician review required (100% of summaries)
- Risk: Model degrades → Mitigation: Monthly eval on locked test set, alert if under 85%

**Week 4**: Dry run
- Model card: ✅ Complete
- Risk register: ✅ Complete
- Access logs: ✅ Exported (last 90 days)
- Incident response: ✅ Tested kill switch (under 2 minute response time)
- **Gap found**: Data retention schedule not documented → Fixed (7-year policy added to wiki)

**Audit Result (Nov 15)**: **Zero findings.** HIPAA certification renewed.

**Time Investment**: 12 hours (Sept prep) vs. 40+ hours (remediation if gaps found).

- [ ] Incident response runbook (step-by-step, tested)
- [ ] Quarterly review cadence (re-eval models, update risk registers)

**If any box is unchecked, you have gaps. Fix them in September, not October.**

## The September Sprint Template

**Sprint Goal**: Make all AI features audit-ready by Oct 1.

**Week 1 Tasks**:
- [ ] PM: Inventory AI features (table with name, risk, scope, DRI)
- [ ] PM: Assign features to team members for documentation

**Week 2 Tasks**:
- [ ] ML: Write model cards (1 per feature, 2-4 hours each)
- [ ] PM: Review model cards (completeness, clarity)

**Week 3 Tasks**:
- [ ] PM + ML: Write risk registers (1 per feature, 3-5 hours each)
- [ ] PM: Collect mitigation evidence (eval reports, test results, logs)

**Week 4 Tasks**:
- [ ] PM: Dry run audit (simulate auditor questions, find gaps)
- [ ] PM + Eng: Fix gaps (missing docs, untested controls, incomplete logs)
- [ ] PM: Package artifacts (Dropbox folder for auditor)

**Standup Questions**:
- What AI feature are you documenting this week?
- Any blockers (missing data, unclear ownership)?
- Are you on track for Oct 1 deadline?

## The Pitch to Your Eng Lead

**PM**: "We need to spend September building compliance artifacts for our AI features. 12-16 hours of team time total."

**Eng Lead**: "We're already behind on roadmap. Can this wait?"

**PM**: "If we don't have this ready, the audit will find gaps. Remediation takes 40+ hours. We'll lose Q4 to fire drills. And if we fail SOC2, enterprise deals freeze."

**Eng Lead**: "What's the alternative?"

**PM**: "12 hours now, or 40+ hours in November. Your call."
