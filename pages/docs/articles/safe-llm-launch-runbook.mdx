## Why Enterprise AI Launches Fail (And How to Prevent It)

Most GenAI features die in legal review or post-launch escalations—not because the technology failed, but because **the launch plan never accounted for enterprise constraints**. Security wants audit trails. Legal demands guardrails. Compliance needs proof of data minimization. And all three expect these controls *before* general availability.

After shipping 1,000+ production commits across AI features in healthcare, legal tech, and consulting platforms, I've learned that **the gap between research demo and enterprise shipment isn't technical—it's operational**. The SAFE-LLM framework codifies the patterns that pass CISO, GC, and compliance review on the first submission.

**SAFE-LLM** stands for:
- **Scoping**: Problem framing + evaluation dataset design
- **Alignment**: Stakeholder sync on metrics, risks, and kill criteria
- **Feedback loops**: Human-in-the-loop + observability
- **Evaluation**: Offline metrics → online A/B → business KPIs
- **Launch governance**: Rollout plan, red-teaming, and documentation

This isn't waterfall. It's a **checklist for shipping safely at speed** in organizations that treat compliance as a product requirement, not an afterthought.

## The SAFE-LLM Framework

### 1. Scoping: Start with Evaluation, Not Features

**The Research Standard**: NeurIPS and ICML now require artifact checklists—code, data, and reproducibility details. Enterprise AI should adopt the same discipline: define your evaluation dataset *before* you write the PRD.

**What This Looks Like in Practice**:

```
Step 1: Define task success in user terms
- "Summarize patient notes" → "Reduce physician review time by 30% without missing critical symptoms"
- "Generate contract clauses" → "Drafts pass senior attorney approval 80%+ of the time"

Step 2: Build a golden dataset (100–500 examples)
- Source: real user inputs (anonymized/synthetic if needed)
- Labels: expert judgments or existing outcomes
- Coverage: edge cases, adversarial inputs, domain jargon

Step 3: Lock the eval set version
- Treat it like a unit test suite—no tweaking after tuning starts
- Version control + access logs (who modified what, when)
```

**Why This Matters**: If you can't measure it offline, you can't defend it to legal. A reproducible eval set becomes your **safety case artifact**.

**PM Checklist**:
- [ ] Task definition with quantified success criteria
- [ ] 100+ labeled examples covering happy path + edge cases
- [ ] Version-controlled dataset with provenance (source, date, annotator)
- [ ] Offline baseline metric (e.g., GPT-4 on locked eval = 72% F1)

---

### 2. Alignment: Pre-Commit to Kill Criteria

**The Causal Inference Principle**: Before you run an A/B test, declare your decision rule. If you move the metric but can't explain *why*, you're in data-mining territory—not science.

**What This Looks Like in Practice**:

```
Stakeholder Alignment Doc (1-pager):

1. Success Metric (online)
   - Primary: support ticket deflection rate (target: +15%)
   - Secondary: CSAT ≥4.0/5, avg resolution time ↓20%

2. Guardrail Metrics
   - Hallucination rate <5% (sampled via human review)
   - Latency p95 <3s
   - Cost per query <$0.08

3. Kill Criteria (auto-rollback if any trigger)
   - Error rate >2%
   - User complaints >10/day mentioning "wrong info"
   - Security alert on PII leakage

4. Rollout Plan
   - Week 1: 5% internal beta
   - Week 2: 10% GA if no kills
   - Week 4: 50% if guardrails hold
   - Week 6: 100% or rollback
```

**Why This Matters**: Your CISO and GC will ask, "What happens if it hallucinates?" If your answer is "we'll monitor," you'll get a no. If your answer is "we auto-rollback at 5% hallucination rate based on sampled review," you'll get approval.

**PM Checklist**:
- [ ] 1-page alignment doc signed by Eng, Legal, Security, Support
- [ ] Declared kill criteria with auto-rollback triggers
- [ ] Metrics dashboard live *before* experiment starts
- [ ] Escalation DRI (who gets paged if guardrails trip)

---

### 3. Feedback Loops: Human-in-the-Loop by Default

**The HCI Research**: CHI studies show users over-rely on AI when confidence signals are missing. Calibrated UX—flagging uncertainty, enabling corrections—reduces automation bias.

**What This Looks Like in Practice**:

```
Design Pattern: Confidence + Correction

User sees:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AI-generated summary (90% confident)│
│ [👍 Looks good] [✏️ Edit] [🚫 Reject]│
└────────────────────────────────────┘
└─ Logging: accepted/edited/rejected + session ID

Backend:
- Log every interaction (user ID, input, output, feedback, timestamp)
- Sample 5% of "accepted" outputs for expert review
- Flag outputs where model confidence <70% for mandatory review
```

**Why This Matters**: You need a **human review corpus** to prove accuracy in audits. "Our model is 95% accurate" won't fly. "We sampled 500 accepted outputs; experts agreed 92% of the time" will.

**PM Checklist**:
- [ ] Thumbs-up/down or edit affordance in UX
- [ ] Sampling plan: X% of outputs reviewed by domain experts
- [ ] Logging schema: input, output, user feedback, reviewer judgment
- [ ] Monthly review SLA: report accuracy/hallucination trends to stakeholders

### 4. Evaluation: Offline → Online → Business

**The NIST AI RMF**: Map technical metrics to organizational risks. "Accuracy" is a lab metric. "Support ticket deflection" is a business metric. Your roadmap needs both.

**What This Looks Like in Practice**:

```
Metric Cascade:

Offline (pre-launch):
- F1 on golden eval set: 78%
- Latency p95: 2.1s
- Cost per 1k queries: $4.20

Online (A/B, week 1–2):
- Treatment group sees +12% ticket deflection
- CSAT: 4.2 vs. 4.1 control (not sig)
- Error rate: 0.8% (within SLA)

Business (post-rollout, month 1–3):
- Support ticket volume ↓18% (compound effect)
- Avg resolution time ↓22%
- ARR impact: $240k annualized from support cost savings
```

**Why This Matters**: Your exec review isn't "the model works." It's "we shipped measurable value and contained risk."

**PM Checklist**:
- [ ] Offline metrics tied to eval dataset (reproducible)
- [ ] Online A/B with pre-declared success criteria
- [ ] Business KPIs tracked for 90 days post-rollout
- [ ] Monthly readout: what changed, what we learned, next bets

### 5. Launch Governance: The Six-Artifact Standard

**The EU AI Act Context**: High-risk AI systems require technical documentation, conformity assessments, and post-market monitoring. Even if you're not EU-regulated *today*, this is where procurement standards are headed.

**What This Looks Like in Practice**:

**Launch Artifacts (templates ready before GA)**:

1. **Model Card** (1 page)
   - Model version, training data summary, intended use, limitations
   - Example: "GPT-4-turbo, fine-tuned on 10k anonymized case summaries; not for diagnostic use"

2. **Evaluation Report** (2–3 pages)
   - Offline metrics on locked eval set
   - Online A/B results + statistical significance
   - Guardrail performance (hallucination rate, latency, cost)

3. **Risk Register** (1 page)
   - Top 5 risks, mitigations, owners
   - Example: "Hallucination → human review required for confidence below 70%"

4. **Data Provenance Log** (table)
   - Training/eval data sources, licenses, PII handling
   - Retention policy + deletion SLA

5. **Red-Team Report** (1–2 pages)
   - Adversarial test results (jailbreaks, prompt injections, PII leaks)
   - Mitigations deployed (input filters, output validators)

6. **Rollout Plan** (1 page)
   - Staged rollout % + timeline
   - Kill criteria + rollback playbook
   - Escalation contacts

**Why This Matters**: When legal or compliance asks "show me the documentation," you hand them six PDFs and a dashboard link. Approval in under 48 hours instead of a 3-month review cycle.

**PM Checklist**:
- [ ] All six artifacts drafted before GA
- [ ] Artifacts version-controlled (like code)
- [ ] Legal/Security/Compliance sign-off on final versions
- [ ] Post-launch: update artifacts if metrics/risks change

## Case Example: Shipping a Legal-Research Assistant (90-Day Sprint)

**Context**: AmLaw 200 firm wants GenAI to summarize case law for associates. Must not hallucinate citations, must log all queries for privilege review, must stay SOC2 compliant.

**SAFE-LLM in Action**:

### Weeks 1–2: Scoping
- Built golden eval set: 200 real research queries (anonymized), labeled by senior attorneys
- Baseline: GPT-4 on eval = 68% citation accuracy (unacceptable)
- Task redefinition: "Retrieve top 5 cases + generate 2-sentence summaries" instead of freeform drafting

### Week 3: Alignment
- Kill criteria: citation hallucination >5%, latency >5s, any PII leak
- Stakeholder doc signed by GC, IT, KM partner

### Weeks 4–6: Feedback Loops + Eval
- Added "Verify citations" button (forces attorney review before use)
- Logged all queries + attorney edits
- A/B test (10% beta): citation accuracy 89%, latency 3.2s, zero PII incidents

### Weeks 7–8: Governance
- Six artifacts completed: model card, eval report, risk register, data log, red-team report, rollout plan
- Legal review: approved in 5 days (artifacts answered all questions upfront)

### Weeks 9–12: Rollout
- Staged: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100% over 4 weeks
- Business outcome: associates saved 4.2 hrs/week on research; firm tracked $180k/year in associate time savings

**What Made This Work**: We didn't argue "the model is good enough." We showed reproducible evals, guardrails, logging, and a rollback plan. The artifacts did the persuading.

## Why This Framework Scales

**SAFE-LLM isn't about process theater**—it's about embedding the discipline of reproducible research into product delivery. When you start with evaluation datasets, declare kill criteria, log feedback loops, and ship artifacts, you're not slowing down. You're **de-risking the path to GA**.

The companies that ship AI at scale (and keep shipping) treat compliance as a product surface, not a gate. This runbook is how you build that muscle.

**Next Steps**:
- Adapt this checklist for your next AI feature
- Start with the eval dataset (even 50 examples beats zero)
- Share the stakeholder alignment template with your CISO
