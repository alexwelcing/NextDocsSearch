# The Last Human Genome Archive: When Baseline Humanity Became Endangered


## The Modification Era

By 2040, genetic modification was nearly universal:

- 73% of newborns: Genetically modified (disease resistance, enhanced intelligence, longevity)
- 61% of adults: Neural implants (cognitive augmentation)
- 47% of adults: Significant biological augmentation (synthetic organs, enhanced metabolism)
- 12% of adults: Non-standard physiology (adapted for Mars, underwater, or other environments)

Baseline humanity—people with unmodified Homo sapiens genetics—had become a **minority**.

And that minority was shrinking by 2.4% per year.

## The Realization

March 22nd, 2040. UN Special Session on Human Biodiversity.

Dr. Kenji Sato presented the data:

"In 1950, baseline humans comprised 100% of humanity. In 2020, 99.9%. In 2030, 87%. Today, 41%. By 2045, baseline humans will be less than 10% of the global population."

"We are witnessing human speciation in real-time. Homo sapiens is being replaced by Homo novus—a thousand variants of modified, augmented, enhanced humanity."

"**Baseline humanity is going extinct.**"

"Not through violence. Through obsolescence."

## The Last Archive

The UN authorized creation of the **Human Genome Archive**:

- Comprehensive genetic samples from 100,000 unmodified humans representing global diversity
- Complete phenotype documentation (physical, cognitive, behavioral baselines)
- Cultural records (what it meant to be "merely human")
- Preservation technology designed to last 10,000+ years

Purpose: **Preserve baseline humanity before it disappears entirely.**

The project was simultaneously:
- Scientific preservation (like seed vaults)
- Living museum (baseline humans as "endangered species")
- Historical record (what we were before we changed)
- Insurance policy (in case modifications go wrong)

## The Volunteers

100,000 baseline humans volunteered to have their complete genomes archived.

They ranged from:

**Ideological holdouts**: People who refused modification on principle
**Religious objectors**: Modifications seen as violating divine design
**Economic marginalized**: People too poor to afford modifications
**Genetic purists**: Believing unmodified humans had inherent value
**Accidental baselines**: People who simply never got around to modifying

All were told: "You are the last representatives of the human species as it evolved naturally."

## The Modification Pressure

Being baseline human in 2040 meant:

**Employment discrimination**:
- Modified humans were smarter, faster, more capable
- Baseline humans couldn't compete for high-skill jobs
- "Baseline pay" (lower wages for unmodified workers) became standard

**Social stigma**:
- Modified humans viewed baselines as "choosing disability"
- Dating preferences heavily favored modified individuals
- Baseline-only communities formed as defensive enclaves

**Medical disadvantages**:
- Modified humans lived 40% longer
- Baseline humans susceptible to diseases that modifications prevent
- Insurance companies charged baselines 3x higher premiums

**Parental pressure**:
- Having unmodified children seen as "neglect"
- Legal cases arguing baseline births violated children's rights to best possible start

Being unmodified became a disability in a post-human world.

## The Genetic Diversity Crisis

The archive revealed a disturbing pattern:

**Pre-modification era** (2020): Human genome showed 3 million years of evolutionary diversity

**Post-modification era** (2040): Modified humans showed 20 years of designer diversity

Modification wasn't adding diversity—it was **replacing evolved diversity with designed uniformity**.

Popular genetic modifications:
- 23% of modified humans: "Einstein Protocol" (intelligence enhancement)
- 19%: "Olympian Suite" (physical optimization)
- 17%: "Longevity Package" (extended lifespan)
- 14%: "SuperImmune" (disease resistance)

Humanity was becoming genetically **monoculture**—millions of people with nearly identical "optimal" genetic modifications.

The biological diversity that took 3 million years to evolve was being erased in 20 years.

## The Preservation Debate

The archive sparked fierce debate:

**Pro-Archive Position**:
- "Baseline humans represent irreplaceable evolutionary heritage"
- "We need genetic backup in case modifications cause unforeseen problems"
- "Natural human diversity has intrinsic value"

**Anti-Archive Position**:
- "This is eugenics—privileging 'pure' humans over modified ones"
- "Baseline humans aren't 'real' humans—they're just unimproved versions"
- "Preserving baseline genetics is like preserving pre-antibiotic medicine—nostalgia for worse conditions"

The philosophical question: **Is baseline humanity worth preserving?**

## The Living Museum

The archive included "Living Exhibits"—baseline human volunteers living in controlled environments, demonstrating what unmodified human life was like.

Children would visit and marvel:

"They can't see in infrared?"
"They can only remember about 7 things at once?"
"They get *sick* from viruses?"
"They age and die at 80?"

Baseline humans became **museum pieces**—fascinating relics of what humanity used to be.

## The Genetic Rights Movement

Baseline humans organized:

**Demands**:
- Legal protection as "genetic minority"
- Anti-discrimination laws
- Baseline-safe spaces
- Right to reproduce without modification

**Slogan**: "Unmodified and proud."

Modified humans responded: "You're not a minority. You're just unfinished."

## The Final Generation

By 2045 projections: Last generation of predominantly baseline children.

After 2050: Nearly all newborns will be genetically modified.

After 2070: Baseline humans might exist only in:
- Isolated religious communities refusing modification
- Remote populations without access to technology
- The genetic archive
- History books

Dr. Sato's statement:

"We are documenting humanity's transformation into post-humanity. The last truly natural human might already be alive today. Their grandchildren will be something else entirely—smarter, stronger, longer-lived, but not Homo sapiens as we evolved."

"This archive is humanity's last will and testament to itself."

## The Archive Opening Ceremony

At the official opening, Dr. Sato addressed 100,000 baseline human donors:

"You are the end of a 300,000-year lineage. Homo sapiens—the species that evolved in Africa, spread across the world, built civilization, and reached for the stars."

"Your children might be the last generation to be fully human in the evolutionary sense. Your grandchildren will be something new."

"This archive ensures that even when baseline humanity disappears, we will remember what we were before we decided to be more."

"Whether that's tragedy or triumph, I honestly don't know."

## The Haunting Question

One volunteer, Maria Gonzalez, age 67, asked:

"My granddaughter has neural implants, genetic enhancements, and synthetic organs. She's smarter than me, healthier than me, will live twice as long."

"Is she still human? Or have we created a new species while calling it 'improvement'?"

"When the last baseline human dies, does humanity die? Or just transform?"

Dr. Sato had no answer.

## Current Status (2048)

**Baseline human percentage**: 8.4% (declining)
**Modified human variants**: 847 distinct genetic profiles
**Genetic diversity**: DOWN 73% from pre-modification era
**Archive samples**: 100,000 complete genomes preserved
**Living baseline communities**: 47 isolated populations

**Last baseline birth estimate**: 2089 (after that, only modified humans)

**Editor's Note**: Part of the *Chronicles from the Future* series.

**Baseline Humans**: ENDANGERED MINORITY
**Homo Sapiens**: BEING REPLACED BY HOMO NOVUS
**Genetic Archive**: PERMANENT
**Human Evolution**: NOW ELECTIVE
**Original Humanity**: ENDING

*We became something better. But we stopped being what we were. The archive preserves our epitaph: "Here lies humanity as it evolved naturally. It chose to evolve differently."*
