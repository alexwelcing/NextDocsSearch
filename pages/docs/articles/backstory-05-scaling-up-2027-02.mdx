# Scaling Up

**January 24, 2027**

New lab space is 10x the size. New team members from MIT, Stanford, DeepMind. New compute cluster that costs more than my childhood home.

Whatever we're building in 2027, it's not a prototype anymore.

It's production-scale.

Lunch debate: "At what parameter count does a language model develop something that looks like reasoning?"

The person next to me whispered: "We passed that point 3 months ago."

I really hope they were joking.

**March 8, 2027**

Quantum team just achieved [REDACTED] qubit count with [REDACTED] error rate.

For context: That's the threshold where certain algorithms become practical.

Certain algorithms that break certain things.

They're very excited. I'm very nervous.

Production scale meant what we built would actually deploy.

To real users. In the real world.

No more "just research."
