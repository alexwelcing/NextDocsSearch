## The Deposition Question You Couldn't Answer

**Opposing Counsel**: "You used AI to select documents for production. Explain your methodology."

**Attorney**: "We trained a model on relevant documents and it ranked the rest."

**OC**: "How many documents did you train it on?"

**Attorney**: "I... don't know. The vendor handled that."

**OC**: "So you can't prove you didn't withhold relevant documents? I move to compel full manual review—all 500,000 documents."

**Judge**: "Motion granted."

**The Cost**: $2M in manual review that could've been avoided with a defensible TAR protocol.

## What Makes TAR "Defensible" in Court

**Three Requirements** (established in *Da Silva Moore v. Publicis*, 2012 and subsequent cases):

1. **Transparency**: Disclose your methodology to opposing counsel
2. **Proportionality**: Demonstrate TAR is more cost-effective than manual review
3. **Quality Control**: Prove your TAR process achieved reasonable recall

**Key Insight**: You don't need 100% recall. Courts accept 75-80% if the process is defensible.

## The 7-Step Defensible TAR Workflow

### Step 1: Seed Set Creation (Control Set)

**What**: Senior attorney reviews 500-2,000 documents, labels as relevant/not relevant.

**Why**: This "trains" the AI on what relevance looks like.

**Documentation**:
- Who labeled? (name, role, years of experience)
- How many docs? (minimum: 500; recommended: 1,500-2,000)
- Criteria? (written relevance guidelines, shared with opposing counsel)

**Mistake to Avoid**: Using junior associates (opposing counsel will argue they're not qualified).

### Step 2: Model Training

**What**: AI learns from seed set, ranks all 500,000 documents by predicted relevance.

**Documentation**:
- Algorithm used (e.g., "SVM with TF-IDF features" or "fine-tuned BERT")
- Training parameters (iterations, cross-validation folds)
- Who trained it? (vendor name or in-house data scientist)

**Mistake to Avoid**: "Black box" vendor models (you must be able to explain how it works).

### Step 3: Continuous Active Learning (CAL)

**What**: Attorney reviews top-ranked documents first. AI learns from each review, re-ranks remaining docs.

**Example**:
- Round 1: Attorney reviews top 1,000 docs, finds 300 relevant
- AI learns from 300 new relevant examples
- Round 2: AI re-ranks, attorney reviews next 1,000
- Repeat until stopping rule

**Documentation**:
- How many rounds? (typically 5-10)
- How many docs per round? (500-2,000)
- What was the yield per round? (e.g., 30% relevant → 10% relevant → stopping)

### Step 4: Quality Control Sampling

**What**: After CAL, randomly sample 200-500 docs from the "not relevant" pile. Have attorney review.

**Why**: Proves you didn't miss relevant docs.

**Documentation**:
- Sample size (minimum: 200; recommended: 500)
- Who reviewed? (senior attorney, same person who labeled seed set)
- Results: How many were actually relevant? (target: under 5%)

**Red Flag**: If >10% of "not relevant" sample is actually relevant → model is under-performing, need to retrain.

### Step 5: Recall Estimation

**What**: Estimate: Of all relevant documents in the 500,000-doc corpus, what % did we find?

**Formula** (simplified):
```
Estimated Recall = Relevant Docs Found / (Relevant Docs Found + Relevant Docs Missed in Sample)
```

**Example**:
- Found 5,000 relevant docs via TAR
- QC sample of 500 docs from "not relevant" pile found 10 relevant docs
- Extrapolate: If 10/500 = 2%, then estimated 2% of 495,000 "not relevant" docs = 9,900 missed
- Recall = 5,000 / (5,000 + 9,900) = 34% ← **FAIL** (too low)

**Target**: 75%+ recall

**Mistake to Avoid**: Not estimating recall (opposing counsel will assume you missed everything).

### Step 6: Proportionality Analysis

**What**: Prove TAR saved money compared to manual review.

**Documentation**:
```
Manual Review Cost:
- 500,000 docs × 6 minutes/doc × $400/hour = $2,000,000

TAR Cost:
- Seed set: 2,000 docs × 6 min/doc × $400/hour = $8,000
- CAL: 10,000 docs × 6 min/doc × $400/hour = $40,000
- QC sample: 500 docs × 6 min/doc × $400/hour = $2,000
- Vendor fee: $50,000
- Total: $100,000

Savings: $1,900,000 (95% cost reduction)
```

**Why This Matters**: Judge weighs cost vs. benefit. If TAR saves $1.9M and achieves 78% recall, it's defensible.

### Step 7: Cooperation with Opposing Counsel

**What**: Disclose methodology before starting TAR. Invite opposing counsel to negotiate protocol.

**Example Communication**:
```
Subject: Proposed TAR Protocol for Document Review

Opposing Counsel,

We propose using Technology-Assisted Review for this case. Proposed methodology:

1. Seed set: 2,000 docs, labeled by Senior Partner [Name]
2. Algorithm: SVM with TF-IDF (vendor: Relativity)
3. Continuous active learning: 5-10 rounds
4. QC sampling: 500 docs from "not relevant" pile
5. Target recall: 75%+

We're open to discussing this protocol. Please advise if you have concerns.

Regards,
[Attorney]
```

**Why This Matters**: Courts favor cooperation. If you negotiate upfront, opposing counsel can't challenge later.

## Real Example: Contract Dispute Litigation

**Case**: Vendor sues client for breach of contract. 500,000 emails to review.

**TAR Protocol**:

**Seed Set** (Week 1):
- Senior attorney reviews 1,500 emails
- Labels 400 as relevant (contract discussions, payment disputes)
- Documents relevance criteria: "Any email mentioning contract terms, payment, deliverables, or disputes"

**Model Training** (Week 1):
- Vendor (Relativity) trains SVM classifier
- Accuracy on held-out test set: 87%

**Continuous Active Learning** (Weeks 2-4):
- Round 1: Review top 2,000 emails, 35% relevant (700 docs)
- Round 2: Review next 2,000, 28% relevant (560 docs)
- Round 3: Review next 2,000, 18% relevant (360 docs)
- Round 4: Review next 2,000, 9% relevant (180 docs)
- **Stopping rule met**: Yield dropped below 10%

**Quality Control** (Week 5):
- Random sample of 500 emails from "not relevant" pile
- Senior attorney reviews: 12 are actually relevant (2.4%)
- Extrapolate: ~12,000 relevant docs missed

**Recall Estimation**:
- Found: 1,800 relevant docs (via CAL)
- Missed (estimated): 12,000
- Recall: 1,800 / (1,800 + 12,000) = 13% ← **PROBLEM**

**Fix** (Week 6):
- Retrain model with stricter relevance criteria
- Re-run CAL (3 more rounds)
- New QC sample: 500 docs, 8 relevant (1.6%)
- New recall estimate: 78% ← **PASS**

**Production** (Week 7):
- Produce 2,100 relevant docs to opposing counsel
- Disclose TAR methodology (seed set size, algorithm, recall estimate)

**Opposing Counsel's Challenge**:
- "You only achieved 78% recall. What about the other 22%?"

**Attorney's Response**:
- "Manual review rarely exceeds 80% recall (studies show 60-70% is typical)."
- "TAR cost $120k vs. $2M for manual review."
- "Court in *Da Silva Moore* accepted 75% recall as reasonable."

**Judge's Ruling**: TAR protocol is defensible. No additional review required.

## The TAR Transparency Checklist

Disclose these to opposing counsel:

- [ ] Seed set size and labeling criteria
- [ ] Algorithm/vendor used
- [ ] Number of CAL rounds
- [ ] Documents reviewed per round (and yield)
- [ ] QC sample size and results
- [ ] Estimated recall
- [ ] Cost comparison (TAR vs. manual review)

**If you withhold any of these, opposing counsel will cry foul.**

## Common PM Mistakes (For Legal Tech Products)

**Mistake 1: Not Documenting Seed Set Creation**
- **Reality**: If you can't prove who labeled and how many docs, TAR is challengeable
- **Fix**: Log every label (user ID, timestamp, relevance decision)

**Mistake 2: No Recall Estimation**
- **Reality**: Opposing counsel will assume recall is 50% if you don't estimate it
- **Fix**: Build QC sampling into your TAR workflow (not optional)

**Mistake 3: "Black Box" Models**
- **Reality**: If attorney can't explain the algorithm, judge may reject TAR
- **Fix**: Use interpretable models (SVM, logistic regression) OR provide model cards for deep learning

## Checklist: Is Your TAR Product Court-Ready?

- [ ] Logs seed set creation (who, when, how many, criteria)
- [ ] Supports continuous active learning (multi-round review)
- [ ] Generates QC sample (random sample from "not relevant")
- [ ] Estimates recall (not just precision)
- [ ] Exports TAR protocol report (for disclosure to opposing counsel)
- [ ] Documents cost savings (TAR vs. manual review)
- [ ] Provides model card (algorithm, parameters, interpretability)
