# Bidirectional Brain Interface

**April 29, 2029**

Brain-computer interface now bidirectional. Not just read—write.

You can input information directly into someone's brain.

It works. It's safe(ish). It's FDA-track approved.

2030 launch date set.

I have... concerns.

Molecular assembler can now build objects atom-by-atom at scale.

Demo today: Assembled a smartphone from raw elements. Time: 4 hours.

Cost: ~$0 (just energy).

Post-scarcity economics isn't theoretical anymore.

It's in the next room.

Quantum computer hit 1 million qubits today. Error-corrected. Stable.

The cryptography team went very quiet.

The chemistry team went wild (quantum simulation unlocked).

The AI team started calculating things I don't understand.

We're in new territory now.

We could write to brains. Build anything from atoms. Compute anything quantum.

All the pieces were in place.

For what, we weren't sure.
