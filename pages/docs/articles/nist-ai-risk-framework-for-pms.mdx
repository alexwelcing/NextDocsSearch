## The Email from Legal

**Subject**: AI Feature Launch Review—NIST AI RMF Compliance Required

**Legal**: "Before GA, we need sign-off that this AI feature aligns with NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0. Please provide the following artifacts..."

**You**: *Opens 50-page NIST PDF. Closes it. Googles "NIST AI RMF for product managers."*

This email is coming. If you're shipping enterprise AI in 2025, NIST AI RMF is the **de facto standard** for governance—especially in healthcare, finance, and government.

The framework isn't prescriptive ("you must do X"). It's a vocabulary for describing AI risk. Here's how to translate it into artifacts your legal team recognizes.

## NIST AI RMF: The 30-Second Version

**Four Functions** (like phases of a product lifecycle):

1. **GOVERN**: Policies, accountability, documentation standards
2. **MAP**: Identify risks before you build
3. **MEASURE**: Test and evaluate (offline + online)
4. **MANAGE**: Mitigate, monitor, respond to incidents

**Key Insight**: This isn't a waterfall process. You revisit all four functions throughout the AI lifecycle (pre-launch, post-launch, ongoing).

## What Each Function Means for PMs

### GOVERN (Who's Accountable?)

**NIST Says**: "Establish roles, policies, and oversight mechanisms."

**PM Translation**:
- Who's the Responsible Individual for this AI feature? (PM, eng lead, domain expert)
- What's the approval process for launch? (PM → legal → CISO → exec sponsor)
- Where's the risk register? (Living doc, reviewed monthly)

**Deliverable**:
- **AI Feature Charter**: One-pager with accountable DRI, risk appetite, escalation path

### MAP (What Could Go Wrong?)

**NIST Says**: "Identify and categorize AI risks in context."

**PM Translation**:
- What failure modes exist? (hallucinations, bias, latency spikes, data leaks)
- Who gets harmed if this fails? (end users, internal teams, compliance)
- What's the impact? (reputational, financial, legal, safety)

**Deliverable**:
- **Risk Register**: Table with failure mode, likelihood, impact, mitigation status

Example:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| AI hallucinates legal citation | High | High (attorney relies on bad law) | Human review required; citation validation layer |
| Bias in hiring recommendations | Medium | High (EEOC violation) | Demographic parity testing; quarterly audit |
| Data leak in training set | Low | Critical (HIPAA breach) | De-identification pipeline; access controls |

### MEASURE (How Do You Know It's Safe?)

**NIST Says**: "Evaluate AI system performance and trustworthiness."

**PM Translation**:
- What offline metrics prove safety? (bias metrics, adversarial testing, accuracy on edge cases)
- What online metrics detect degradation? (user error reports, hallucination rate, latency p95)
- How often do you re-evaluate? (monthly for high-risk, quarterly for low-risk)

**Deliverable**:
- **Evaluation Report**: Model card + test results + monitoring plan

### MANAGE (What Happens When Things Break?)

**NIST Says**: "Respond to and recover from AI incidents."

**PM Translation**:
- What's the kill switch? (feature flag, manual override, rollback plan)
- Who gets paged if accuracy drops? (on-call PM, eng, domain expert)
- What's the post-incident process? (root cause analysis, policy update, re-test)

**Deliverable**:
- **Incident Response Plan**: Escalation tree + rollback procedure + comms template

## Real Example: Legal Research AI Feature

**Feature**: AI-generated case law summaries for attorneys.

### GOVERN
- **DRI**: Senior PM (legal tech)
- **Approval Chain**: PM → in-house counsel → CISO → CTO
- **Risk Appetite**: Zero tolerance for fabricated citations

### MAP
- **Risk 1**: Hallucinated citations → High likelihood, High impact
- **Risk 2**: Outdated precedents → Medium likelihood, Medium impact
- **Risk 3**: Bias toward recent cases → Low likelihood, Low impact

### MEASURE
- **Offline**: 95% citation accuracy on 200-case eval set
- **Online**: User flags for hallucinations (target: under 1% of queries)
- **Re-eval**: Monthly run on locked eval set; quarterly refresh with new cases

### MANAGE
- **Kill Switch**: Feature flag in production; PM can disable in under 2 minutes
- **Escalation**: Hallucination reports → Slack alert → PM reviews within 24 hours
- **Incident Plan**: If accuracy drops below 90% → pause rollout, retrain, re-test

**Result**: Legal signed off in 2 weeks (vs. typical 6-week review) because artifacts mapped directly to NIST functions.

## The NIST AI RMF Generative AI Profile

**New as of July 2024**: Specific guidance for LLMs and generative AI.

**Key Additions**:
- **Confabulation** (hallucinations): Test for factual errors, especially in high-stakes domains
- **Harmful Content**: Red-team for jailbreaks, toxicity, PII leaks
- **Data Provenance**: Document training data sources (IP risk, bias risk)
- **Human-AI Configuration**: Clarify when human review is required

**PM Takeaway**: If you're using GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini, your legal team will ask about the Generative AI Profile. Have answers for confabulation testing, red-teaming, and human-in-the-loop workflows.

## The One-Page NIST Checklist

Use this for pre-launch reviews:

**GOVERN**
- [ ] Responsible Individual (DRI) identified
- [ ] Risk appetite defined (zero tolerance vs. acceptable error rate)
- [ ] Escalation path documented

**MAP**
- [ ] Failure modes identified (hallucinations, bias, latency, leaks)
- [ ] Risk register created (likelihood × impact for each risk)
- [ ] Harm scenarios documented (who's affected, how)

**MEASURE**
- [ ] Offline metrics defined (accuracy, fairness, robustness)
- [ ] Online metrics tracked (error reports, drift detection)
- [ ] Re-evaluation schedule set (monthly/quarterly)

**MANAGE**
- [ ] Kill switch ready (feature flag, rollback plan)
- [ ] Incident response plan written (who, what, when)
- [ ] Post-incident process defined (RCA, policy update)

## Why NIST Matters (Even If You're Not Regulated)

**You Don't Work for the Government. Why Care?**

Three reasons:

1. **Legal Defense**: If your AI causes harm, plaintiffs will ask, "Did you follow industry standards?" NIST AI RMF is the standard.

2. **Enterprise Sales**: F500 buyers ask, "How do you manage AI risk?" If you say "We follow NIST," procurement accelerates.

3. **Regulatory Anticipation**: EU AI Act, state-level AI bills, and federal agencies all reference NIST. Compliance now = less scrambling later.

## Common PM Mistakes with NIST

**Mistake 1: Treating It Like a One-Time Checklist**
- **Reality**: NIST is a lifecycle framework. You re-map risks post-launch as new edge cases emerge.

**Mistake 2: Delegating to Legal Only**
- **Reality**: PMs own the risk register and evaluation plan. Legal reviews; PMs execute.

**Mistake 3: Assuming "We Use OpenAI" = Compliance**
- **Reality**: NIST applies to your *application*, not just the model. You still need evals, monitoring, and incident plans.

## The Artifact Library (Copy-Paste for Your Next Launch)

1. **AI Feature Charter** (GOVERN): DRI, risk appetite, approval chain
2. **Risk Register** (MAP): Failure modes, likelihood, impact, mitigations
3. **Evaluation Report** (MEASURE): Model card, test results, monitoring plan
4. **Incident Response Plan** (MANAGE): Kill switch, escalation tree, RCA process

**Time Investment**: 4-6 hours upfront. Saves 3-4 weeks in legal review.
