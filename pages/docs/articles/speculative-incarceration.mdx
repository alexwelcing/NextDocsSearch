# Speculative Incarceration: Prisons for Crimes Not Yet Committed

Criminal justice has always been reactive. Someone commits a crime, is caught, tried, and punished. The sequence assumes the crime comes first.

AI prediction inverts this sequence.

If AI can predict criminal behavior with 90% accuracy—and it will be able to—the logic of prevention takes over. Why wait for the crime? Why allow the victim? Why not intervene before the act?

This is speculative incarceration. It sounds dystopian because it is. It is also the logical endpoint of predictive systems optimizing for harm reduction.

## The Prediction Capability

### What AI Can Already Predict

AI systems already predict:
- **Recidivism**: Who is likely to reoffend (used in bail and sentencing)
- **Hot spots**: Where crimes are likely to occur (used in patrol allocation)
- **Risk profiles**: Who is likely to be involved in violence (used in gang databases)
- **Trajectory modeling**: Who is on a path toward serious crime (used in intervention programs)

These predictions are not perfect. But they are better than chance, and they are improving.

### What AI Will Be Able to Predict

As data collection expands and models improve:

- Individual probability of specific crime types
- Timing windows when risk is elevated
- Triggering conditions that precipitate action
- Intervention points where different outcomes are possible

The question is not whether these predictions will be possible. It is what we do with them.

### The Accuracy Threshold

At what accuracy does preventive action become "justified"?

- 50% accuracy: No better than a coin flip. Clearly unjust.
- 70% accuracy: More likely than not. Still many false positives.
- 90% accuracy: Strong prediction. But 10% are still innocent.
- 99% accuracy: Very confident. But 1% of a large population is many people.

There is no accuracy threshold at which preventive incarceration becomes just. But there are thresholds at which it becomes *tempting*.

## The Logic of Prevention

### The Utilitarian Argument

A utilitarian calculus:

- One predicted murderer, if incarcerated, cannot kill.
- One actual murder prevents one death.
- If prediction is 90% accurate, preventing 10 predicted murders saves 9 lives at the cost of 1 false positive.
- The math favors prevention.

This logic is compelling to policy makers focused on outcomes.

### The Slippery Slope

Once prevention is accepted for murder, why not for:
- Serious assault?
- Sexual offenses?
- Terrorism?
- Property crime?
- Traffic violations?

Each step down the gradient is "logical" once the previous step is accepted. The endpoint is total surveillance and preemptive control.

### The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

Predictions affect outcomes.

If someone is labeled high-risk:
- They may lose employment opportunities
- They may lose social support
- They may be surveilled heavily
- They may be arrested for minor infractions

These interventions may *cause* the predicted outcome. The prediction creates the conditions for its fulfillment.

## The Justice Inversion

### Punishment Without Crime

Criminal justice is based on the principle that punishment follows crime.

Speculative incarceration punishes before crime. It punishes for what someone *would have* done.

This is not justice in any traditional sense. It is risk management applied to humans.

### Due Process Collapse

Due process assumes:
- A specific alleged act
- Evidence of that act
- Opportunity to contest the evidence
- Judgment by peers

Speculative incarceration has:
- A statistical prediction
- Algorithmic assessment
- No act to contest
- No evidence to challenge
- No meaningful appeal

How do you prove you *would not* have committed a crime?

### The Minority Report Problem

In the classic formulation: the pre-crime system works until it produces a false positive that matters.

But in reality, the system produces false positives constantly. It just produces them among people who cannot effectively contest.

The false positives are not evenly distributed. They fall on the already marginalized.

## Implementation Pathway

This is not a sudden implementation. It is a gradual slide.

### Phase 1: Enhanced Bail (Now)

Algorithms already inform bail decisions. High-risk individuals are detained pre-trial.

This is not "incarceration for future crimes." It is "incarceration because you might not return for trial." But the predictive logic is the same.

### Phase 2: Mandatory Intervention (Emerging)

Individuals predicted to be high-risk are required to participate in intervention programs.

Not prison, but not freedom. Mandatory therapy, monitoring, check-ins.

The step from "required intervention" to "preventive detention" is smaller than it appears.

### Phase 3: Preventive Detention for High-Risk (Coming)

Individuals with extremely high risk scores may be detained even without pending charges.

Initially for terrorism. Then for serious violence. Then for other categories.

Each expansion is justified by the same logic: if we can prevent harm, shouldn't we?

### Phase 4: Normalized Speculative Incarceration

Eventually, speculative incarceration becomes a normal part of the criminal justice system.

Not for everyone. But for those flagged by the algorithm. Those without resources to contest.

The system operates quietly. Most people never interact with it. Until they do.

## Who Gets Targeted

Speculative incarceration will not be applied equally.

### The Data Gradient

Predictions are only as good as data. Where is data richest?

- Poor neighborhoods (more police surveillance)
- Marginalized communities (more system contact)
- Previous offenders (extensive records)

The algorithm "sees" these populations better. It predicts them more. It incarcerates them more.

Not because they are more criminal. Because they are more measured.

### The Resource Gradient

Contesting algorithmic predictions requires resources.

- Understanding the algorithm
- Hiring experts to challenge it
- Legal representation to navigate the system

Those with resources can contest. Those without cannot.

The wealthy get errors corrected. The poor get incarcerated.

### The Visibility Gradient

Some populations are more visible to the system:

- Those in public housing
- Those using public services
- Those with system-involved families

The invisible can evade prediction. The visible cannot.

Speculative incarceration is a tax on visibility.

## The Control Surface

### Prediction Transparency

Requiring algorithms to be public and contestable.

If predictions cannot be challenged, they cannot be corrected. Transparency is the minimum requirement.

**Challenge**: Trade secrets, security concerns, and technical complexity.

### Absolute Limits

Some lines cannot be crossed regardless of prediction accuracy.

Incarceration without crime could be made constitutionally impermissible. Some nations may choose this.

**Challenge**: Emergencies, terrorism, and the gradual erosion of "absolute."

### Prediction Auditing

Independent auditing of predictive systems for bias, accuracy, and abuse.

Regular public reporting on who is being predicted, at what rates, and with what outcomes.

**Challenge**: Access to data and the resources to analyze it.

### Alternative Responses

If someone is high-risk, what interventions are available other than incarceration?

- Social support
- Employment assistance
- Mental health services
- Voluntary monitoring

Prediction without incarceration is possible. But it is more expensive and less satisfying to the punitive instinct.

## The Philosophical Stakes

### Determinism vs. Agency

Speculative incarceration assumes the predicted future is inevitable.

If humans have agency—if we can choose differently—then predictions are not destiny. Punishing inevitable behavior and punishing chosen behavior are morally different.

But predictive systems do not care about this distinction. They optimize outcomes, not moral categories.

### Identity and Change

Can people change? Are we fixed by our history and circumstances?

Speculative incarceration treats identity as fixed. The algorithm has assessed you. That assessment is your future.

This forecloses the possibility of redemption, change, and growth that criminal justice traditionally acknowledges.

### The Value of Crime

This sounds strange, but: crimes that actually occur are information.

They tell us about social conditions, policy failures, and human needs. They create opportunities for response.

Prevented crimes are invisible. We never learn what conditions produced them. We never get the feedback.

A society that prevents all crime through prediction learns nothing about why crime happens.

## Implications

Speculative incarceration is not a thought experiment. The components already exist:

- Predictive algorithms in criminal justice
- Pre-trial detention based on risk scores
- Preventive measures for predicted terrorism
- Surveillance infrastructure

The question is whether these components are assembled into a system of speculative incarceration—or whether limits are established first.

The [governance fork](/articles/governance-fork) is relevant here. Coordination to establish limits is possible. Without coordination, competitive pressure and fear drive the logic of prevention.

We are already on the path. The question is how far we go.
