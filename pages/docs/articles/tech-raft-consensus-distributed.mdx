# Raft Consensus Algorithm
Raft provides understandable consensus for distributed systems. Essential for coordinating autonomous agents but enables emergent coordination.
## Implementation
\`\`\`python
class RaftNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = 'follower'  # follower, candidate, or leader
        self.current_term = 0
        self.voted_for = None
        self.log = []

    def request_vote(self, term, candidate_id):
        if term > self.current_term:
            self.current_term = term
            self.voted_for = candidate_id
            return True
        return False

    def append_entries(self, term, leader_id, entries):
        if term >= self.current_term:
            self.state = 'follower'
            self.log.extend(entries)
            return True
\`\`\`
**⚠️ Risk**: Autonomous systems using Raft can coordinate without human oversight.
