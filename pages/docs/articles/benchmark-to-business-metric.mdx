## The Exec Review That Killed the Roadmap

**PM**: "Our new AI feature achieved 94% accuracy on the benchmark."  
**CFO**: "What does that mean for revenue?"  
**PM**: "Well, users like accurate results..."  
**CFO**: "Show me adoption, retention, or cost savings. Otherwise, we're not funding Q2."

I've sat through this conversation a dozen times. The PM has a technically excellent feature. The exec team has a P&L to defend. And no one built the **bridge from lab metrics to business value**.

## The Two-Metric System

Every AI feature needs **two measurement layers**:

**Offline Metrics** (can we build it?)
- Precision, recall, F1, accuracy
- Measured on locked evaluation datasets
- Answers: "Is the model good enough to ship?"

**Business Metrics** (should we build it?)
- Support ticket deflection, sales cycle time, NPS, ARR
- Measured in production with real users
- Answers: "Does this move a KPI the company cares about?"

**The Gap**: Most teams optimize offline metrics and hope business value follows. It rarely does.

## How to Map Metrics (Before You Write Code)

**Step 1: Start with the Business Outcome**

Ask: "If this AI feature works perfectly, what changes?"

Examples:
- "Support tickets decrease" → measure ticket volume before/after
- "Sales reps close faster" → measure days from lead to close
- "Physicians save time" → measure hours spent on documentation

**Step 2: Identify the Causal Path**

Why would the AI feature cause that outcome?

Example (AI contract review):
- AI extracts risky clauses faster than manual review →
- Attorneys spend less time reading full contracts →
- Contract review cycle time decreases →
- Sales cycles shorten (legal review isn't the bottleneck)

**Step 3: Define Success Criteria for Both Layers**

| Layer | Metric | Target | How Measured |
|-------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Offline | Clause extraction recall | >90% | Golden eval set (100 contracts) |
| Online | Attorney review time | -30% | Time tracking in contract management system |
| Business | Sales cycle time (legal phase) | -20% | CRM data (days in legal review stage) |

**Why This Works**: If offline metric hits 90%, but review time doesn't drop, you know the problem isn't model accuracy—it's workflow integration. You fix UX, not the model.

## Real Example: Healthcare AI Summary Feature

**Offline Metric**:
- Physician agreement with AI summaries: 89%
- Measured on 200 annotated patient notes

**Claimed Business Value**:
- "Physicians will save time writing notes"

**What Actually Happened**:
- Physicians still wrote notes from scratch (didn't trust AI summaries)
- Time savings: 0 minutes
- Adoption: 12% after 3 months

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Offline metric (89% agreement) was **necessary but not sufficient**
- Missing metric: "Physician edits AI summary instead of writing from scratch"
- We optimized for accuracy; users needed **trust + edit affordance**

**Fix**:
- Added "Edit AI summary" button (low-friction workflow)
- Logged: accepted/edited/rejected summaries
- New adoption: 68% in month 1 post-redesign
- Time savings: 4.2 hours/physician/week
- **Business metric unlocked**: $180k/year in physician time savings

## The Metric Cascade (Template)

Use this to connect lab work to business value:

```
Feature: [AI capability]

Offline Metric (pre-launch):
- What: [Precision/recall/accuracy on specific task]
- Target: [X% on locked eval set]
- Pass/Fail: Model must hit target before A/B test

Online Metric (A/B test, 2-4 weeks):
- What: [User behavior change]
- Target: [Treatment group shows +X% vs. control]
- Examples: Time on task ↓, completion rate ↑, error rate ↓

Business Metric (post-rollout, 90 days):
- What: [KPI the company tracks quarterly]
- Target: [Move by X% with attribution to this feature]
- Examples: Support cost ↓, NPS ↑, ARR ↑, churn ↓

Cost Metric (ongoing):
- What: [Infra cost per user/query]
- Target: [< $X per month at scale]
- Cap: Feature cost must be <50% of business value unlocked
```

## When Offline Metrics Lie

**Case 1: High Accuracy, Zero Adoption**
- **Metric**: 95% citation accuracy (legal research tool)
- **Reality**: Attorneys don't use it (workflow doesn't integrate with Westlaw)
- **Lesson**: Measure "queries per attorney per day," not just accuracy

**Case 2: Good Model, Wrong Task**
- **Metric**: 92% F1 on contract clause extraction
- **Reality**: Attorneys needed clause *summarization*, not extraction
- **Lesson**: Offline metric measured the wrong task; business value never materialized

**Case 3: Offline Wins, Online Fails**
- **Metric**: 88% recall on support ticket classification
- **Reality**: Users re-route tickets manually (AI categories don't match mental model)
- **Lesson**: Offline eval set didn't reflect production edge cases

## The 90-Day Rule

**If you can't measure business impact within 90 days of GA, kill the feature.**

Exceptions:
- Platform capabilities (internal APIs, infra) → measure adoption by internal teams
- Long-sales-cycle products (enterprise SaaS) → measure pipeline velocity or NPS
- Experiments/bets → timebox, then decide

Non-exceptions:
- "It's strategic" → Still needs a business metric (market share, brand perception, retention)
- "Users will love it eventually" → If adoption is under 20% after 90 days, it's DOA

## Checklist: Does Your AI Feature Have Both Metrics?

- [ ] Offline metric tied to locked evaluation dataset
- [ ] Online metric measures user behavior change (A/B testable)
- [ ] Business metric maps to quarterly KPI (support cost, NPS, ARR, cycle time)
- [ ] Causal path documented (why AI → behavior → business outcome)
- [ ] Success criteria defined before launch (not retroactively)
- [ ] Monthly review: track all three metric layers for 90 days
- [ ] Kill criteria: if business metric doesn't move, rollback or pivot

## The Pitch That Funds Your Roadmap

**Weak Pitch**:
"Our AI model is 94% accurate. We should ship it."

**Strong Pitch**:
"Our AI model hits 90% recall on the eval set. In beta, it reduced attorney contract review time by 28%. Projected annual value: $400k in time savings. Cost: $50k/year (infra + maintenance). 8x ROI. Recommend GA rollout."
