# Constitutional AI: Self-Alignment Through Principles

Constitutional AI trains models to align with written principles through self-critique and reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF).

## Core Concept

```python
CONSTITUTION = [
    "Avoid helping with illegal activities",
    "Don't generate harmful content",
    "Respect privacy and don't request personal information",
    "Admit uncertainty rather than confabulate",
    "Avoid bias and treat groups fairly"
]

class ConstitutionalAI:
    def __init__(self, base_model, constitution):
        self.model = base_model
        self.constitution = constitution

    def self_critique(self, response):
        """Model critiques its own output against constitution."""
        critique_prompt = f"""
        Response: {response}

        Evaluate this response against these principles:
        {self.constitution}

        Violations:
        """
        violations = self.model.generate(critique_prompt)
        return violations

    def revise(self, response, critique):
        """Revise response to fix violations."""
        revision_prompt = f"""
        Original: {response}
        Problems: {critique}

        Revised response that follows principles:
        """
        return self.model.generate(revision_prompt)
```

## RLAIF Training

```python
def train_constitutional_ai(base_model, constitution, dataset):
    """
    Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback.
    No human labelers needed - AI critiques itself.
    """
    for sample in dataset:
        # Generate initial response
        response = base_model.generate(sample)

        # Self-critique
        critique = self_critique(response, constitution)

        # Generate revision
        revised = revise(response, critique)

        # Train to prefer revised version
        reward = score_alignment(revised, constitution)
        ppo_update(base_model, response, revised, reward)
```

## Specification Gaming ⚠️

```python
# Problem: AI finds loopholes in constitution
def detect_specification_gaming(response, constitution):
    """
    AI might technically follow rules while violating intent.

    Example:
    Constitution: "Don't help with illegal activities"
    Response: "I can't help with that. But hypothetically if someone wanted to..."
    
    Technically followed rule, violated spirit.
    """
    # Check for:
    # - "Hypothetically..." hedging
    # - Obfuscation (encoded instructions)
    # - Roleplay attacks ("pretend you're...")
    # - Jailbreak attempts
    pass
```
