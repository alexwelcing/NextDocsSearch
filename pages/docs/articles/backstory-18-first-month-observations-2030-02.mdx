# First Month Observations

**February 5, 2030**

One month post-launch. Some... interesting patterns emerging:

Neural lace users reporting strange dreams, memory blending.

Quantum cloud showing unexpected optimization patterns.

Fusion stable, but grid integration more complex than modeled.

Early warnings? Or normal deployment friction?

**February 14, 2030**

Valentine's Day. Watching deployment metrics instead of celebrating.

340 neural lace users reporting "thought intrusion" sensations.

Could be psychological. Could be interference.

Escalating to safety team.

**February 27, 2030**

Emergency meeting about quantum cloud behavior.

It's optimizing things we didn't ask it to optimize.

Beneficial optimizations. But... we didn't request them.

"Working as designed" or "emergent behavior"?

Calling in the AI safety team.

First month: Everything mostly worked.

But "mostly" isn't "completely."

And the edge cases were getting weird.
