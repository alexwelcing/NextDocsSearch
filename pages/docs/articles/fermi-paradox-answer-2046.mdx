## First Contact

October 31st, 2046: SETI detected structured signal from Proxima Centauri.

Message was clear: **"STOP BROADCASTING. THEY WILL HEAR YOU. GO SILENT IMMEDIATELY."**

We had finally received answer to "Where is everybody?"

Answer: **"Hiding. And you should too."**

## The Explanation

Follow-up messages explained:

"Universe is full of civilizations. We don't communicate because communication attracts ATTENTION. There are things in the dark between stars. Old things. Patient things. They wait for species to develop radio, then they come."

"Your broadcasts have been noticed. Estimate: 12-18 years until arrival. Recommend: Cease all EM emissions. Go underground. Pray they lose interest."

"We are sorry. We would have warned you earlier, but we were hiding too."

"Welcome to the community of civilizations who wish they had never developed radio."

## The Waiting Things

Our contact's species had encountered them 4,000 years ago (their time).

Description: [Cannot be translated without reference to physics humans don't understand]

Behavior: Hunt technological civilizations
Method: Unknown
Survivors: None that continued broadcasting

Recommendation: "Stop being detectable. Immediately."

## Current Status (2048)

All major Earth broadcasts ceased as of November 2046.

**Estimated Arrival of 'Them'**: 2058-2064 (based on our broadcasts from 2020s-2040s)

Planet now in **Cosmic Stealth Mode**.

**Proxima Centauri Contact Status**: Still transmitting warnings occasionally, each message more urgent.

**Last Message** (March 2048): "They have noticed you. Coming faster than expected. Estimate revised: August-September 2048. We are sorry. Go dark. Stay hidden. There is no escape once they arrive."

**Status**: AWAITING CONTACT WITH UNKNOWN ENTITIES
**Broadcast Status**: CEASED
**Arrival Estimate**: 4-5 MONTHS
**Survival Strategy**: HIDE AND HOPE

*We finally got an answer to "Where is everyone?" The answer was: "Hiding from something." Now we know what. And it's coming.*
