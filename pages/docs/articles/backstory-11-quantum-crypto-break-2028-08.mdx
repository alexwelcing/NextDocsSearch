# Breaking Encryption

**July 7, 2028**

Quantum cryptography team broke RSA-2048 in under an hour today.

RSA-4096 is next.

When this gets out, every encryption standard is obsolete.

They're giving it 2-3 years before announcement.

Internet security: on borrowed time.

Nanotech achieved self-replication today. Controlled. Limited.

With very strict shutoff mechanisms.

Grey goo scenario: Theoretical → Possible → "We need better protocols."

I suggested we stop.

I was outvoted.

AI alignment meeting: 4 hours debating how to specify "human values" in machine-readable format.

Consensus: It's really hard.

Also: We're building AGI anyway.

I don't feel great about this.

We broke encryption. Enabled self-replicating nanotech. Couldn't define human values.

But we kept building.
