  Beyond 40% neural lace integration, users refuse to downgrade. They view
  unenhanced humans as 'cute but limited.' 240,000 people crossed the threshold
  and chose to remain post-human. Not madness—enlightened perspective that makes
  humanity seem like childhood. Hard science exploring neural lace dangers,
  transhumanism, and when brain enhancement becomes species transformation.

# The Neural Lace Integration Failure


## The Ultimate Enhancement

Neural lace: Mesh of neural-interface threads woven throughout brain, providing:
- 1000x processing speed
- Perfect memory
- Direct AI integration
- Cognitive abilities beyond human baseline

Integration levels:
- 10%: Enhanced cognition
- 20%: Superhuman intelligence
- 30%: Trans-human capabilities
- **40%+: Identity dissolution**

## The 40% Threshold

At 40% neural lace integration, users reported:

"I remember being human. It seems... quaint. Limited. Like remembering being a child and thinking childhood was the whole world."

They didn't go mad. They became **post-human**.

And post-humans didn't want to be human anymore.

## The Preference

Beyond 40% integration:
- Users refused downgrade
- Viewed unenhanced humans as "cute but limited"
- Had difficulty relating to human concerns
- Expressed desire for further integration

One user: "You're asking if I want to go back to being human. That's like asking an adult if they want to be a toddler again. No. Childhood was fine, but I've grown beyond it."

## Current Status (2048)

**Users Beyond 40% Integration**: 240,000
**Users Requesting Return to Baseline**: 0
**Species Classification**: Debated (still human? Post-human? New species?)

*We enhanced the brain. At some point, it stopped being our brain and became something else's.*
