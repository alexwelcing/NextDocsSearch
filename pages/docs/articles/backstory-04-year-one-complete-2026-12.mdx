# Year One Complete

**October 29, 2026**

Halloween party at the lab. Someone came dressed as "aligned AGI."

Everyone laughed nervously.

The alignment team did not think it was funny.

Milestone: The thing we've been building for 11 months just passed its first real-world test. Can't say what it does. But it worked exactly as designed.

2026 wrapped. This year I:
- Signed 23 NDAs
- Worked on 4 projects I can't discuss
- Saw tech that won't be public for 5-10 years
- Questioned the wisdom of building it (often)

2027: We're going bigger. Way bigger.

---

First year: Excitement outweighed fear.

That balance wouldn't last.
