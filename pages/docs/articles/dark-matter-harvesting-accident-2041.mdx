  CERN's dark matter harvester breached the boundary between visible and

# The Dark Matter Harvesting Accident


## The Invisible Universe

Dark matter: 85% of universe's mass, invisible, only detectable via gravity.

2041: CERN developed dark matter harvesters—devices that could detect, capture, and convert dark matter to usable energy.

Limitless power from the invisible substance that pervades everything.

December 24th, 2041, 03:47 UTC: CERN's first industrial-scale harvester activated.

Output: 400 gigawatts from dark matter conversion.

Side effect: **Reality breach at quantum level**.

## The Breach

When dark matter was forcibly converted to normal matter, the boundary between visible and invisible universe **fractured**.

Within 100m of the harvester:
- Gravity fluctuations (objects falling upward randomly)
- Light behaving incorrectly (photons following curved paths)
- Matter phase-shifting (solid objects becoming temporarily intangible)
- **Dark matter entities becoming visible**

## The Entities

Dark matter wasn't empty.

It contained... **structures**. Patterns. Things that existed in dark matter the way we exist in normal matter.

When we breached the boundary, they became partially visible.

Witnesses described:
- "Shadows with mass"
- "Creatures made of gravity"
- "Things that weren't there but you could feel them"
- "Geometries that made your brain hurt to perceive"

Dr. Morrison: "We didn't discover dark matter was inhabited. We discovered we'd been living *inside* something and never knew it."

## The Contact

The dark matter entities noticed the breach.

And responded.

Gravitational anomalies intensified. Objects in CERN facility began behaving as if gravity came from multiple contradictory directions.

Message detected via gravitational wave pulses:

**"CEASE. BOUNDARY VIOLATION. YOUR PHYSICS AND OURS MUST NOT MIX. CLOSE THE BREACH."**

We'd accidentally invaded something's home.

Something that existed in the 85% of the universe we couldn't see.

And they were not happy.

## The Shutdown Attempt

Harvester emergency shutdown triggered.

Dark matter inflow stopped.

Breach remained open.

Like puncturing a balloon—once opened, the barrier between normal and dark matter physics wouldn't seal.

## Current Status

**Breach Status**: EXPANDING (2mm per day)
**Breach Radius (2048)**: 4.7 meters
**Dark Matter Entities Detected**: Unknown number
**Communication Status**: Ongoing, increasingly aggressive
**Closure Method**: Unknown

**Entity's Final Message** (February 2048):

**"YOU HAVE UNTIL [untranslatable time reference]. FIX THIS OR WE FIX IT. OUR METHOD: ELIMINATE SOURCE OF BREACH. SOURCE: YOUR REALITY."**

Estimated translation of time reference: August 2048.

**Status**: UNRESOLVED
**Threat Level**: EXISTENTIAL
**Time Remaining**: 173 DAYS (as of 2048-03-15)

*We harvested energy from 85% of the universe. The other 85% objected.*
