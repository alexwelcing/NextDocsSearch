# Point of No Return

**October 27, 2029**

Watched a full-scale demo today of systems we've been building for 4 years.

When they all work together: 🤯

When I think about what happens if one goes wrong: 😰

We're past the point of no return.

Launch: 2030.

Final safety review. Question asked: "Are we sure we should deploy this?"

Long silence.

Answer: "We've come too far to stop. And if we don't, someone else will—with less care."

Not exactly reassuring.

Last post before 2030.

Everything we've built goes live next year:
- Neural interfaces
- Quantum computing
- Molecular assembly
- AI (very advanced AI)
- Gene therapy
- Fusion power

The future arrives in 2030.

I hope we're ready. I don't think we are.

See you on the other side.

We crossed the point of no return.

Not when we built it.

When we decided to deploy it.
