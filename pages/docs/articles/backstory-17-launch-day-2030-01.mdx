# Launch Day

**January 1, 2030**

Happy New Year! 🎉

Also: First commercial neural lace implants available today.

First quantum cloud services online.

First fusion plants operational.

The future is here. Whether we're ready or not.

(Narrator: We were not ready.)

**January 15, 2030**

Two weeks into public launch.

47,000 neural lace sign-ups (waiting list: 2.4M)

Quantum cloud: 10,000 enterprise customers

Fusion plants: Powering 23 cities

Everything working as designed.

...mostly.

**January 28, 2030**

First bug reports coming in.

Nothing critical. Yet.

But watching real users interact with tech we built in a lab...

It's different when consequences are real.

Sleep has been difficult.

Launch day: Celebration + dread.

We built the future.

Now we had to live in it.
