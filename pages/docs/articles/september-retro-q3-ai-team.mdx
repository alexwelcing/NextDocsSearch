## The Q3 Review That Exposed the Real Blockers

**CEO**: "We planned to ship 6 AI features in Q3. We shipped 3. What happened?"

**PM**: "Well, Feature A got delayed by compliance, Feature B by data quality issues, Feature C by..."

**CEO**: "Are these one-offs, or do we have systemic problems?"

**PM**: *Realizes no one has been tracking delay patterns.*

**The Fix**: Monthly retrospectives → identify patterns → fix root causes (not symptoms).

## The Q3 Retrospective Framework

**Three Questions**:
1. **What shipped?** (wins)
2. **What didn't ship?** (delays)
3. **What patterns emerge?** (systemic issues)

**Output**: Action items for Q4 (not just "we'll try harder").

## Real Q3 Retrospective: Legal Tech Startup

**Team**: 5 engineers, 2 PMs, 1 data scientist

**Q3 Goals**: Ship 6 AI features

**Results**: 3 shipped, 3 delayed

### What Shipped (Wins)

**Feature 1**: Contract clause extraction AI (deployed Aug 15)
- **Why it shipped**: Model was ready by July, UX was simple (one button), compliance already approved for previous feature (no new review needed)

**Feature 2**: AI-powered search (deployed Aug 22)
- **Why it shipped**: Used existing model (no retraining), frontend-only changes, no PII concerns

**Feature 3**: Legal citation validator (deployed Sep 10)
- **Why it shipped**: PM wrote compliance docs in advance (no delay waiting for legal team)

### What Didn't Ship (Delays)

**Feature 4**: AI contract summarization (planned July, now Oct)
- **Delay cause**: Legal review took 6 weeks (not 2 weeks as estimated)
- **Root cause**: PM didn't know legal team was understaffed in July (vacation season)

**Feature 5**: Bias detection in hiring docs (planned Aug, now Nov)
- **Delay cause**: Training data quality issues (50% of labels were wrong, had to re-label)
- **Root cause**: PM didn't QA the labeled dataset before training started

**Feature 6**: Multi-language support (planned Sep, now Q1 2026)
- **Delay cause**: Model accuracy in Spanish was 68% (vs. 89% in English)—not shippable
- **Root cause**: PM assumed "fine-tune on Spanish data" would work; didn't test early enough

### Patterns (Systemic Issues)

**Pattern 1: Compliance Reviews Take 4-6 Weeks (Not 2)**
- **Impact**: 2 of 3 delays were compliance-related
- **Fix**: Start compliance docs 8 weeks before planned launch (not 4 weeks)

**Pattern 2: Data Quality Not Checked Until Training Starts**
- **Impact**: 1 feature delayed 3 months to re-label data
- **Fix**: Add "Data QA Week" to project plan (before training, not during)

**Pattern 3: Multi-Language Features Underestimated**
- **Impact**: Spanish model took 2x longer than expected (low accuracy, needed more data)
- **Fix**: Add 4-week buffer for non-English features; test on small dataset first

## The Action Items Template

**For Each Pattern, Define**:
1. **Problem**: What went wrong?
2. **Root Cause**: Why did it happen?
3. **Fix**: What will we change in Q4?
4. **Owner**: Who's responsible?
5. **Deadline**: When will this be implemented?

**Example**:

| Problem | Root Cause | Fix | Owner | Deadline |
|---------|------------|-----|-------|----------|
| Compliance reviews take 6 weeks (not 2) | PM didn't account for legal team workload | Start compliance docs 8 weeks before launch; check legal team calendar for conflicts | PM (Alex) | Oct 1 |
| Data quality issues delay training | No QA process for labeled datasets | Add "Data QA Week" to project template; PM reviews 10% sample before training starts | PM + Data Scientist | Oct 1 |
| Multi-language features underestimated | Assumed fine-tuning on Spanish data would work without testing | Spike: Test on 100 Spanish examples before committing to feature; add 4-week buffer to estimate | Data Scientist | Oct 15 |

## The "Start, Stop, Continue" Exercise

**For Each Team Member, Ask**:

**START doing** (new practices):
- Start writing compliance docs 8 weeks before launch
- Start QA'ing labeled data before training
- Start testing multi-language features on small datasets first

**STOP doing** (bad habits):
- Stop assuming compliance reviews take 2 weeks (they take 6)
- Stop training models on unvalidated data
- Stop estimating multi-language features same as English

**CONTINUE doing** (what's working):
- Continue writing model cards upfront (Feature 3 shipped on time because docs were ready)
- Continue reusing existing models when possible (Feature 2 shipped fast)
- Continue UX simplicity (one-button features ship faster than complex workflows)

## The Velocity Tracking Dashboard

**Track These Metrics Q3 → Q4**:

| Metric | Q3 Actual | Q4 Target |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Features shipped on time | 50% (3 of 6) | 75% (6 of 8) |
| Compliance review time | 6 weeks | 4 weeks (with 8-week lead time) |
| Data quality issues (features delayed) | 33% (1 of 3 delays) | 10% (max 1 delay) |
| Model accuracy on first attempt | 67% (2 of 3 hit target) | 85% (7 of 8 hit target) |

**How to Use This**: Monthly check-in (are we on track to hit Q4 targets?).

## Real Examples of Q3 Learnings

**Startup A (Healthcare AI)**:
- **Q3 Lesson**: "Red-teaming takes 2 weeks, not 1 day"
- **Q4 Fix**: Add 2-week red-team sprint to every AI feature (before security review)

**Startup B (Legal Tech)**:
- **Q3 Lesson**: "Attorneys need training on AI features (not just docs)"
- **Q4 Fix**: Add 1-week training period for each feature (PM runs 3 workshops with attorneys)

**Startup C (AdTech)**:
- **Q3 Lesson**: "A/B tests need 4 weeks, not 2 weeks, for statistical significance"
- **Q4 Fix**: Extend all A/B tests to 4 weeks; if sample size is too small, expand to 10% of users (not 5%)

## The Blameless Post-Mortem Culture

**Bad Retro**:
- "Feature 4 was delayed because [Engineer] didn't finish the model on time."

**Good Retro**:
- "Feature 4 was delayed because we didn't account for compliance review time. Root cause: PM estimated 2 weeks, actual was 6 weeks. Fix: PM will check legal team calendar and add 8-week buffer in Q4."

**Why This Matters**: Blame kills learning. Focus on systems, not individuals.

## The Q4 Commitments (Based on Q3 Learnings)

**Commitment 1: Compliance Docs Start 8 Weeks Before Launch**
- **What Changed**: PM writes model card, risk register, and red-team report during development (not after)
- **Impact**: No compliance delays in Q4

**Commitment 2: Data QA Week (Before Training)**
- **What Changed**: PM + data scientist review 10% sample of labeled data; fix quality issues before training starts
- **Impact**: No data quality delays in Q4

**Commitment 3: Multi-Language Spike (Before Committing to Feature)**
- **What Changed**: Test on 100 examples in target language; if accuracy is under 80%, add 4-week buffer or kill feature
- **Impact**: No multi-language surprises in Q4

**Commitment 4: A/B Tests Run for 4 Weeks (Not 2)**
- **What Changed**: All A/B tests extended to 4 weeks for statistical significance
- **Impact**: No "inconclusive test" delays in Q4

## Checklist: Is Your Q3 Retro Actionable?

- [ ] Documented: What shipped vs. what didn't
- [ ] Identified: 3-5 patterns (not just one-off issues)
- [ ] Defined: Action items with owners and deadlines
- [ ] Committed: Specific process changes for Q4 (not "we'll try harder")
- [ ] Measured: Velocity metrics to track improvement (Q3 vs. Q4)
- [ ] Blameless: Focused on systems, not individuals

**If any box is unchecked, your retro won't drive change.**

## The Monthly Retro Cadence

**Don't wait for Q4 to reflect on Q3. Run monthly retros**:

**July Retro**:
- What shipped in June? What delayed?
- 1-2 action items for July

**August Retro**:
- What shipped in July? What delayed?
- Did July action items work? (If not, adjust)

**September Retro (Q3 Summary)**:
- Roll up patterns from July + August + September
- Define Q4 process changes

**Why This Works**: Monthly retros catch patterns early (not 3 months later when memory fades).

## The One-Page Q3 Summary (For Your CEO)

```
Q3 RETROSPECTIVE: AI FEATURES

SHIPPED:
✅ Contract clause extraction (Aug 15)
✅ AI-powered search (Aug 22)
✅ Legal citation validator (Sep 10)

DELAYED:
❌ Contract summarization (Oct, was July) - Compliance review took 6 weeks
❌ Bias detection (Nov, was Aug) - Data quality issues (re-labeling)
❌ Multi-language support (Q1 2026, was Sep) - Spanish accuracy too low

PATTERNS:
1. Compliance reviews take 6 weeks (not 2) → Fix: Start docs 8 weeks before launch
2. Data quality not checked until training starts → Fix: Add Data QA Week
3. Multi-language features underestimated → Fix: Test on small dataset first; add buffer

Q4 TARGETS:
- Ship 6 of 8 features on time (75% vs. 50% in Q3)
- Zero compliance delays (with 8-week lead time)
- Zero data quality delays (with QA Week)

CONFIDENCE: High (process changes address root causes, not symptoms)
```

**Time to Prepare**: 2 hours (but saves weeks of delays in Q4).
