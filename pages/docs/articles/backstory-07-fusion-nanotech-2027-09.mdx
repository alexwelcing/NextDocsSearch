# Fusion and Nanotech Breakthroughs

**July 21, 2027**

Ethics workshop #4 this year. Topic: "Unintended consequences of recursive self-improvement in AI systems."

Very theoretical. Very hypothetical.

Definitely not because we're building something that does exactly that.

**August 15, 2027**

Coffee room conversation overheard:

"How long until we can't understand what our own AI is doing?"

"Bold of you to assume we still understand it."

Probably joking. Probably.

Fusion team (yes, we have a fusion team) just achieved net-positive energy. Repeatable. Scalable design.

This will change everything about energy.

When it's announced in ~2030, people will lose their minds.

Worked with quantum + AI teams today on hybrid architecture.

Watching a quantum computer optimize a neural network in real-time feels like witnessing magic.

Or the beginning of something we can't control.

Time will tell which.

Fusion solved the energy problem.

Which meant we could power everything else we were building.

Unlimited energy + unlimited ambition = ?
