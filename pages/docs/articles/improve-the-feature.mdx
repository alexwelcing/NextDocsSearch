Improve the feature by generating multiple options and picking the best one.

## If there is only one solution

The problem is either too small or large and needs to be reformatted, or not enough research on the subject has been conducted. So let's pick a path forward on quickly resolving those questions.

### Demonstrating on a real 3D/ChatGPT integration

Pick any three random project dimensions for the definition, say:

1. UX
2. Performance
3. Creativity

We will define solutions in these directions to evaluate the possibility of each and understand the implications of each.

In this case, we have a 3D space with an HTML user input feature  screen that displays results from a ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo API, and a React-Three-Fiber monitor displaying results.

It's not perfect, and we want to make some improvements before releasing this update. First impressions on what needs to be changed:
