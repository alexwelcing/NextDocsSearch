Improve the feature by generating multiple options and picking the best one.

## If there is only one solution

The problem is either too small or large and needs to be reformatted, or not enough research on the subject has been conducted. So let's pick a path forward on quickly resolving those questions.

### Demonstrating on a real 3D/ChatGPT integration

Pick any three random project dimensions for the definition, say:

1. UX
2. Performance
3. Creativity

We will define solutions in these directions to evaluate the possibility of each and understand the implications of each.

In this case, we have a 3D space with an HTML user input feature  screen that displays results from a ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo API, and a React-Three-Fiber monitor displaying results.

It's not perfect, and we want to make some improvements before releasing this update. First impressions on what needs to be changed:

- [ ] Button text illegible / needs fix
- [ ] Send button has no interaction or state
- [ ] Screens can overlap instead of appearing attached
- [ ] Could use a curve to be larger
- [ ] Camera feels wonky

It's a large list, and we don't have to solve all of the issues but it is helpful to consider the whole system while making improvements. With the dimensions and requests in place, let's test out some ideas.

#### Perfect Machine

This approach will fix the screen and keyboard together with 3D objets, and then have fun on/off states. Include the blog 3D objects as well, creating one large terminal space.

To make it work, we will need to create the objects, attach it all together, and control the camera state where the user can go from center to seated at the desk. We will remove the OG ask box, and transfer those questions into the PC UI.

Extra effort could include on/off animation for the machine, physics interactions, flickers, etc.

#### Projector in the sky

This idea would be to fix a 3D object permanently in a prominent position in the 3D space, and have the option to display large text on it.

The camera doesn't need to move, and there is a button to turn it on. The UI for asking the question is detached, perhaps we just use the existing box.

It should feel fixed into the scene, perhaps incorporated directly into the background image instead of as an object.

#### Movable Tablet

Make the tablet grabbable by the user, and allow them to place it anywhere in the 3D space. They can grow and shrink it on PC, mobile, and XR.

Bonus points if the tablet can be broken, or has realistic mesh interactions with the different scene geometries beyond the 360 sphere.
