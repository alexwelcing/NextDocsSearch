  Not all AI systems require full EU AI Act compliance. Article 13 exemptions
  apply to AI for research, testing, and narrow use cases. Here's when you
  qualify—and when you don't.

## The Compliance Shortcut That Backfired

**Startup**: "Our AI is for research purposes. Article 13 exempts us from EU AI Act compliance."

**Lawyer**: "Is it *only* for research, or do you also use it in production?"

**Startup**: "Well... we test it on real customer data..."

**Lawyer**: "Then you're not exempt. You need full compliance."

**The Mistake**: Misreading Article 13.

## What Article 13 Actually Says

**EU AI Act Article 13**: AI systems developed **exclusively for research, testing, or development** are exempt from compliance requirements **until** they're placed on the market or put into service.

**Key Words**:
- **Exclusively**: Not "mostly" or "primarily"—100% research/testing
- **Until**: The moment you use it in production, exemption ends

## The Three Exemption Categories

### Category 1: Pure Research (Exempt)

**What Qualifies**:
- Academic research (university labs, non-profit institutes)
- No commercial intent
- Results published, not productized
- No real users (only researchers interact with the system)

**Example**: PhD student trains LLM to study bias in language models. Publishes findings. Never deploys to production.

**Status**: ✅ Exempt (Article 13 applies)

### Category 2: Internal Testing (Exempt, Temporarily)

**What Qualifies**:
- Company tests AI internally (not on real customers)
- No production deployment
- Testing phase has defined end date (not indefinite)

**Example**: Legal tech company tests contract AI on synthetic data + internal employee volunteers. No customer data. No production use.

**Status**: ✅ Exempt **while testing**

**Warning**: The moment you deploy to customers (even beta), exemption ends.

### Category 3: Production Pilots (NOT Exempt)

**What Doesn't Qualify**:
- "Beta" testing with real customers
- "Pilot" programs with paying users
- AI in production but "still testing"

**Example**: Healthcare AI deployed to 10 hospitals as "pilot." Real patients affected.

**Status**: ❌ **Not exempt** (this is "putting into service"—full compliance required)

## Real Example: Contract Review AI

**Scenario**: Legal tech startup builds AI to flag risky clauses in vendor contracts.

**Phase 1 (Exempt)**:
- Train AI on public domain contracts (no customer data)
- Test on synthetic examples
- Internal QA only (no external users)
- **Status**: ✅ Exempt (pure testing)

**Phase 2 (Still Exempt, Barely)**:
- 5 employees test AI on real contracts (internal use)
- No customer deployment
- No paid product
- **Status**: ✅ Exempt (internal testing)

**Phase 3 (Exemption Ends)**:
- Launch beta to 10 law firms (real customers)
- Contracts signed (even if free trial)
- AI processes real client contracts
- **Status**: ❌ **Not exempt** (AI is "in service"—compliance required)

**Compliance Trigger**: The moment you give access to customers (even beta), you must comply.

## The "But It's Just a Beta!" Trap

**Startup Logic**: "It's a beta. We're still testing. Article 13 exempts us."

**Legal Reality**: Article 13 exempts *research/testing*, not *beta products*.

**The Test**:
- Are real users affected? → Not exempt
- Are you collecting revenue (or plan to)? → Not exempt
- Is this a step toward commercialization? → Not exempt

**If you answered "yes" to any, you're not exempt.**

## When Article 13 Actually Helps

**Use Case 1: University Spin-Outs**

**Timeline**:
- **Year 1-2**: PhD research (exempt)
- **Year 3**: Spin-out company formed, still in R&D (exempt)
- **Year 4**: First customer pilot → **compliance required**

**Benefit**: 3 years to build without compliance overhead. But compliance is due before launch, not after.

**Use Case 2: Pre-Product AI Experiments**

**Example**: AdTech company experiments with LLM-generated ad copy (internal testing only).

**Status**: Exempt **while experimenting**

**Trigger**: The moment ads go live (even to 1% of users), exemption ends.

**Use Case 3: Open-Source Research Models**

**Example**: Researcher releases pre-trained model on Hugging Face. No commercial intent.

**Status**: ✅ Exempt (pure research release)

**Warning**: If someone else uses your model in production (e.g., healthcare AI), **they** need to comply (not you). But if **you** commercialize it later, compliance is on you.

## Checklist: Are You Actually Exempt?

Answer honestly:

- [ ] Is the AI used **exclusively** for research or testing? (No production use at all)
- [ ] Are zero external users affected? (Only internal employees/researchers)
- [ ] Is there zero commercial intent? (No revenue, no paying customers)
- [ ] Is the testing phase time-bound? (Not "perpetual beta")
- [ ] Will you comply **before** deploying to customers? (Not after)

**If any answer is "no," you're not exempt.**

## What Happens If You Claim Exemption Incorrectly

**Scenario**: Startup deploys AI to customers, claims Article 13 exemption.

**EU Enforcement**:
- Auditor requests compliance documentation
- Startup says "We're exempt (Article 13)"
- Auditor says "You have customers. Not exempt."
- Startup scrambles to build compliance artifacts (3-6 months delay)

**Penalties**:
- Fines up to €30M or 6% of global revenue (for non-compliance)
- Forced shutdown until compliant
- Reputational harm (customers lose trust)

**The Lesson**: Don't stretch exemptions to avoid compliance.

## The Compliant Beta Strategy

**Goal**: Test AI with real users **before** full GA, but stay compliant.

**How**:
1. **Build compliance artifacts during beta** (not after)
2. **Limit beta scope** (10-50 users, not 10,000)
3. **Disclose beta status** ("This is experimental AI—human review required")
4. **Document everything** (model card, risk register, human oversight plan)

**Result**: You're compliant during beta. When you go GA, you're already ready.

## The Article 13 Decision Tree

```
Is your AI in production or beta with real users?
├─ YES → Not exempt. Full compliance required.
└─ NO → Continue

Is your AI used only by internal employees/researchers?
├─ YES → Possibly exempt. Continue.
└─ NO → Not exempt (external users = "in service")

Is there zero commercial intent (no revenue, no customers, no product plan)?
├─ YES → Likely exempt (pure research).
└─ NO → Not exempt (commercial R&D ≠ pure research)

Do you plan to deploy to customers within 12 months?
├─ YES → Build compliance now (exemption ends soon).
└─ NO → Exempt for now, but re-check in 6 months.
```

## Common PM Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Treating "Beta" as "Exempt"**
- **Reality**: Beta with customers = production (not exempt)
- **Fix**: Build compliance before beta, not after GA

**Mistake 2: Assuming "Internal Testing" Lasts Forever**
- **Reality**: Article 13 exempts time-bound testing, not perpetual pilots
- **Fix**: Set compliance deadline (e.g., "6 months of testing, then comply or kill")

**Mistake 3: Ignoring Spin-Out Transition**
- **Reality**: University research → startup → customers = exemption ends at customer #1
- **Fix**: Budget compliance costs into fundraising (not "we'll figure it out later")
