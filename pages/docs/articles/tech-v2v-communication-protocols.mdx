# V2V Communication
Vehicles communicate to coordinate driving. Enables platooning, intersection management, emergent swarm behavior.
## Protocol
\`\`\`python
class V2VProtocol:
    def broadcast_state(self):
        """Broadcast position, velocity, intent every 100ms"""
        message = {
            'id': self.vehicle_id,
            'position': self.gps.get_position(),
            'velocity': self.speed,
            'heading': self.direction,
            'intent': 'turning_left'  # Planned action
        }
        self.dsrc.broadcast(message, range=300)  # 300m range

    def receive_neighbors(self):
        """Receive broadcasts from nearby vehicles"""
        neighbors = self.dsrc.receive_all()
        return [v for v in neighbors if v.distance < 300]

**Latency**: <100ms critical for safety
**⚠️ Risk**: Coordinated behavior without human control
