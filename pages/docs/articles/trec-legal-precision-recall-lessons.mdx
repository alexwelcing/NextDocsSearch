## The $2M Document Review Budget

**General Counsel**: "We have 500,000 documents to review for this litigation. At $400/hour for contract attorneys, that's $2M. Can your AI reduce that?"

**You** (PM): "Our AI achieves 90% recall—it'll find 90% of relevant documents."

**GC**: "What about the other 10%? If we miss a smoking-gun email, we lose the case. Not acceptable."

**You**: "We can tune for higher recall, but precision drops—you'll review more irrelevant documents."

**GC**: "So what's the right tradeoff?"

**You**: *Googles "precision recall tradeoff legal". Finds TREC Legal Track. Spends 3 hours reading. Returns with an answer.*

## What TREC Legal Track Is (And Why It Matters)

**TREC** = Text Retrieval Conference (NIST-sponsored, 1992-present)

**Legal Track** (2006-2011): Benchmark competition for eDiscovery AI systems.

**The Task**: Given a litigation topic (e.g., "Find all emails about Project X price-fixing"), rank 500,000+ documents by relevance.

**The Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1, and **cost-effectiveness** (how much money does the AI save vs. manual review?).

**Why PMs Care**: TREC Legal Track spent 15 years solving the **precision-recall tradeoff** for high-stakes enterprise use cases. The lessons generalize to any AI feature where:
- Missing a relevant item is expensive (high recall required)
- Reviewing false positives wastes time (high precision required)
- You can't have both at 100%

## The Three Cost Functions (eDiscovery Edition)

### Cost 1: Review Cost
- **What**: Attorney time reviewing documents flagged by AI
- **Formula**: `# of flagged docs × $400/hour × 6 minutes/doc`
- **PM Translation**: False positives are expensive (wasted attorney time)

### Cost 2: Miss Cost
- **What**: Penalty for missing relevant documents
- **Formula**: `# of missed docs × $10,000` (court sanctions, case loss, reputational harm)
- **PM Translation**: False negatives are **catastrophic** (regulatory/legal risk)

### Cost 3: Baseline Cost
- **What**: Manual review of all 500,000 documents (no AI)
- **Formula**: `500,000 docs × $400/hour × 6 minutes/doc = $2M`
- **PM Translation**: Your AI must cost less than manual review, or it's not adopted

**The Optimization Problem**: Minimize `Review Cost + Miss Cost` while staying under `Baseline Cost`.

## The TREC Lesson: Precision-Recall Curves Are Useless Without Cost

**Bad Metric**:
```
Our AI achieves:
- Precision: 85%
- Recall: 90%
- F1: 0.87
```

**So What?** Is that good enough to deploy? Should we tune for higher recall? The metrics don't tell you.

**Good Metric**:
```
Scenario 1: Tune for Recall (95%)
- Review 100,000 docs (20% of corpus)
- Find 950 of 1,000 relevant docs (miss 50)
- Review Cost: $400k
- Miss Cost: $500k (50 × $10k)
- Total Cost: $900k (saves $1.1M vs. manual review)

Scenario 2: Tune for Precision (90%)
- Review 20,000 docs (4% of corpus)
- Find 800 of 1,000 relevant docs (miss 200)
- Review Cost: $80k
- Miss Cost: $2M (200 × $10k)
- Total Cost: $2.08M (WORSE than manual review!)

Scenario 3: Balanced (Precision 85%, Recall 90%)
- Review 50,000 docs (10% of corpus)
- Find 900 of 1,000 relevant docs (miss 100)
- Review Cost: $200k
- Miss Cost: $1M (100 × $10k)
- Total Cost: $1.2M (saves $800k vs. manual review)
```

**Which scenario do you ship?** Depends on the **miss cost** your stakeholder will tolerate.

## The Decision Framework (Copy-Paste for Your Feature)

**Step 1: Define the Cost Function**

Ask your stakeholder:
- "What's the cost of reviewing a false positive?" (wasted time)
- "What's the cost of missing a true positive?" (risk, lost opportunity)
- "What's the baseline cost of doing this manually?" (status quo)

**Step 2: Map Precision-Recall to Costs**

Use this formula:
```
Total Cost = (False Positives × Review Cost per Item) + (False Negatives × Miss Cost per Item)
```

**Step 3: Find the Optimal Operating Point**

- Plot precision-recall curve
- For each point, calculate total cost
- Pick the point with **minimum total cost**

**Step 4: Validate with Stakeholders**

Show them:
- "At 90% recall, we miss 100 items, costing $1M in risk"
- "At 95% recall, we miss 50 items, costing $500k in risk, but review cost increases $120k"
- "Which tradeoff do you prefer?"

## Real Example: Contract Review AI

**Use Case**: AI flags risky clauses in vendor contracts (e.g., unlimited liability, auto-renewal).

**Stakeholder**: Legal team (15 attorneys, 200 contracts/month)

### Cost Analysis

**False Positive** (AI flags safe clause as risky):
- Attorney spends 10 minutes reviewing
- Cost: $67 (attorney billable rate)

**False Negative** (AI misses risky clause):
- Contract signed with risky clause
- Average cost: $50k (renegotiation, potential litigation)

**Baseline** (manual review):
- 200 contracts × 2 hours/contract × $400/hour = $160k/month

### Precision-Recall Scenarios

| Precision | Recall | FP (per 200 contracts) | FN (per 200 contracts) | Review Cost | Miss Cost | Total Cost | Savings |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| 70% | 95% | 60 | 1 | $4k | $50k | $54k | $106k |
| 85% | 90% | 30 | 2 | $2k | $100k | $102k | $58k |
| 95% | 80% | 10 | 4 | $670 | $200k | $201k | **-$41k** |

**Insight**: High-precision tuning (95%) **loses money** because miss cost dominates. Optimal: 70% precision, 95% recall.

**GC's Reaction**: "I'll tolerate 60 false positives/month if we catch 95% of risky clauses. Ship it."

## When to Tune for Precision vs. Recall

### Tune for Recall (Minimize Misses)
**When**:
- Miss cost >> review cost
- High-stakes decisions (healthcare, legal, safety)
- Regulatory requirement (must find all instances)

**Examples**:
- Cancer screening (missing diagnosis = catastrophic)
- Fraud detection (missing fraud = financial loss)
- eDiscovery (missing document = court sanctions)

**Tradeoff**: Users review more false positives, but tolerate it because **missing a true positive is unacceptable**.

### Tune for Precision (Minimize Noise)
**When**:
- Review cost >> miss cost
- Low-stakes recommendations (content, shopping)
- User tolerance for false positives is low

**Examples**:
- News recommendations (showing irrelevant article = user ignores)
- Search ranking (bad result = user scrolls past)
- Spam filtering (false positive = annoying, not catastrophic)

**Tradeoff**: Some true positives get missed, but users tolerate it because **false positives waste their time**.

## The TREC "Technology-Assisted Review" Insight

**Key Finding from TREC Legal 2009-2011**:

**Continuous Active Learning** (CAL) beats traditional keyword search by **10x cost reduction**.

**How It Works**:
1. AI ranks all 500,000 docs by predicted relevance
2. Attorneys review top-ranked docs first
3. AI learns from attorney labels (relevant/not relevant)
4. AI re-ranks remaining docs
5. Repeat until stopping condition (e.g., "reviewed 50,000 docs, found 10 relevant docs in last 5,000")

**Result**:
- Traditional: Review 200,000 docs to find 90% of relevant docs
- CAL: Review 20,000 docs to find 90% of relevant docs
- **10x efficiency gain**

**PM Takeaway**: If your AI ranks items by relevance, **prioritize review of high-confidence items first**. Don't force users to review in random order.

## The "Stopping Rule" Problem

**Question**: When do you stop reviewing AI-flagged items?

**Bad Answer**: "Review until we hit 95% recall."  
**Problem**: You don't know when you've hit 95% recall until you review everything (defeats the purpose).

**TREC Solution**: Stopping rules based on **diminishing returns**.

**Rule 1: Knee of the Curve**
- Track: Relevant docs found per 1,000 docs reviewed
- Stop when: Yield drops below threshold (e.g., 10 relevant docs per 1,000 reviewed)

**Rule 2: Budget-Based**
- Track: Total review cost
- Stop when: Cost approaches baseline (no more savings)

**Rule 3: Risk-Based**
- Track: Estimated recall (via sampling)
- Stop when: Estimated recall > 90% with 95% confidence

**PM Takeaway**: Ship AI with a **recommended stopping rule**. Don't make users guess when to stop reviewing.

## Checklist: Precision-Recall Audit for Your Feature

- [ ] Define false positive cost (time wasted per incorrect flag)
- [ ] Define false negative cost (risk per missed item)
- [ ] Define baseline cost (manual process without AI)
- [ ] Plot precision-recall curve (vary classification threshold)
- [ ] Calculate total cost for each operating point (FP cost + FN cost)
- [ ] Identify minimum-cost operating point
- [ ] Validate with stakeholders (show cost tradeoffs, not just metrics)
- [ ] Implement stopping rule (when to stop reviewing AI-flagged items)
- [ ] Monitor post-launch: track FP rate, FN rate, user satisfaction

## Common PM Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Optimizing F1 Without Knowing Cost Ratio**
- **Reality**: F1 assumes equal cost for FP and FN. Rarely true in enterprise.
- **Fix**: Use cost-weighted metric: `Total Cost = FP × C1 + FN × C2`

**Mistake 2: Shipping Without Stopping Rule**
- **Reality**: Users don't know when to stop reviewing. They review everything (no efficiency gain).
- **Fix**: Add UI: "Recommended stopping point: 95% estimated recall reached"

**Mistake 3: Ignoring Active Learning**
- **Reality**: Random review order wastes time (users review low-relevance items early).
- **Fix**: Rank by AI confidence; users review high-confidence items first

## The 15-Year TREC Lesson

**2006**: Keyword search dominates eDiscovery. AI is experimental.  
**2011**: Technology-Assisted Review (AI + active learning) is standard practice.  
**2025**: Courts accept TAR as defensible (no longer "experimental").

**Timeline for Enterprise AI**: 5-10 years from "experimental" to "industry standard."

**If you're building enterprise AI in 2025, you're at the 2011 TREC moment.** The companies that master precision-recall optimization now will set the industry standard for the next decade.
