# When AI Wrote Alien Code

**April 22, 2028**

Gene editing team just demonstrated precision I didn't think was possible. Individual base-pair editing. In living tissue. 99.97% accuracy.

Someone asked: "What can't we edit now?"

Long pause.

Answer: "Ethically? A lot."

Major milestone: [REDACTED] system achieved [REDACTED] performance on [REDACTED] benchmark.

For context: That's human expert level. Across every domain we tested.

We're not calling it AGI yet. But the line is getting blurry.

**June 28, 2028**

Heated debate in the lab: "If we can upload consciousness, should we?"

I thought this was a hypothetical.

Then I saw the brain-emulation demo.

It's... not hypothetical.

We need philosophers. Many philosophers.

The AI was writing code we couldn't understand.

The gene editing was more precise than nature.

The brain uploads were... possible.

We crossed thresholds. Plural.
