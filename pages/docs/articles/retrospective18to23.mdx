# Introduction

In 2018, I presented at Google Cloud Next on the role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in navigating the labyrinthine world of health taxonomy. Fast forward to 2023, AI's capabilities have grown exponentially. As we anticipate Google Cloud Next 2023, this article serves as a timely reflection on the technological leaps we've observed, offering insights into what the future holds.

## The 2018 Landscape: Contextualizing the Talk

Back in 2018, AI and machine learning were gaining momentum but had not yet become the ubiquitous forces they are today. The healthcare industry was just beginning to scratch the surface of what could be achieved with AI, particularly in the realm of NLP. Tools and algorithms were still in their infancy, and the primary challenge was to efficiently parse and interpret documents stored in various formats like PDFs and HTML pages.

## Fast Forward to 2023: What's Changed?

The advancements in AI and machine learning have been nothing short of revolutionary. Enhanced algorithms, edge computing, and sophisticated cloud-based solutions have made it possible to undertake projects that were once deemed too complex. In the realm of health taxonomy, AI now plays a crucial role in data analytics, predictive modeling, and even real-time decision-making. With the evolution of NLP, machines can now understand the context, sentiment, and intent behind human language, making health-related research and regulations more accessible than ever.

## The Road Ahead: Future of AI in Health Research

As we prepare for Google Cloud Next 2023, the question isn't about whether AI will play a role in health taxonomy; it's about how transformative that role will be. We're at the cusp of a new era where AI could potentially revolutionize personalized healthcare, predictive diagnostics, and much more. The future promises unprecedented integration of AI in healthcare, driving innovation and improving outcomes.

## Conclusion

The strides from 2018 to 2023 have been monumental, positioning AI as an indispensable tool in health research and regulation. This retrospective not only serves as a testament to how far we've come but also sets the stage for our next article, where we'll explore the most exciting prospects for Google Cloud Next 2023. Stay tuned as we delve into the future of AI and machine learning in healthcare, a future teeming with possibilities and promise.
