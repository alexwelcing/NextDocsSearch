**INCIDENT REPORT #7367**
**Date:** 2048-07-04
**Location:** Lunar Colony IT Department (2047)
**Filed By:** Dakota O'Brien, Frontend Framework Curator
**Classification:** Critical Legacy System Failure
**Subject:** Emergency documentation of 2025-era useLoader: Async Asset Management implementation

I never thought I'd be writing one of these again. We all hoped the Great Migration of 2037 had purged the last of the "primitive 3D era" codebases from our systems. We were wrong.

## The Discovery

The system logs showed anomalies dating back to the original deployment in early 2025. As a Frontend Framework Curator stationed at Lunar Colony IT Department (2047), I've seen my share of questionable implementations, but this useloader: async asset management setup was something special.

The codebase had all the hallmarks of "early adoption syndrome" - enthusiastic implementation of bleeding-edge features, minimal documentation, and comments like "TODO: Optimize this later" that were never addressed. The "later" is now. And "later" is terrifying.

### Initial Assessment

The useLoader implementation appeared functional on the surface. But deeper inspection revealed patterns that violated every best practice we've established in the intervening decades. The original developers weren't incompetent - they were pioneers working with tools that were brand new. But pioneers don't always survive to see their discoveries become mainstream.

## Technical Analysis

### The Technical Debt Compounding

The useloader: async asset management implementation followed patterns that were cutting-edge in 2025. But here's what they didn't account for:

1. **Evolution of the React reconciler** - The way React handles 3D scene graphs changed significantly after 2025
2. **WebGL context limitations** - Hardware evolved faster than anyone predicted
3. **Browser rendering pipeline changes** - Chrome 487 doesn't work like Chrome 87
4. **Performance expectations** - Users in 2045 won't accept what users in 2025 tolerated

This is classic The code that works but nobody knows why. It worked perfectly in isolation, on the developer's machine, in 2025. But software doesn't exist in isolation, and time is the ultimate integration test.

### The Real Problem

The issue wasn't the useLoader itself. The issue was the assumptions baked into its implementation - assumptions about hardware, browser behavior, user expectations, and the stability of the ecosystem.

## The Incident

The incident occurred during what should have been routine maintenance. WebGL contexts that refused to die. The useLoader implementation, stable for years, suddenly exhibited behavior that the documentation said was impossible.

### Timeline of Events

**T-0:00** - Initiated standard update procedure
**T+0:15** - First anomalous readings
**T+0:47** - The sound of servers spinning up unexpectedly
**T+1:23** - System behavior diverged from expected parameters
**T+2:01** - Emergency protocols initiated
**T+2:34** - Existential crisis from seeing your own old code

The logs showed the useloader: async asset management implementation doing exactly what it was coded to do. That was the problem. What it was coded to do in 2025 was not what we needed it to do in 2046.

### The Horror of Working Code

This wasn't a bug. This was worse than a bug. This was **correct behavior in the wrong context**. The code was functioning perfectly according to its 2025 specifications. But specifications age poorly.

## Resolution and Lessons Learned

### The Fix

The resolution required rewriting the useloader: async asset management implementation using modern patterns. This wasn't a patch. This was archaeological reconstruction.

We had to:

1. **Understand the original intent** - What were they trying to achieve?
2. **Identify the modern equivalent** - How do we achieve this in 2048?
3. **Migrate without breaking existing integrations** - Other systems depend on this
4. **Document for the next Frontend Framework Curator** - Because we won't be the last

### Lessons Learned

- **Document your assumptions** - The code you write today will be the legacy code someone maintains in 2045
- **Prepare for evolution** - Every abstraction you create should expect the ground to shift beneath it
- **Version your patterns** - What works today might not work tomorrow
- **Have empathy for your future maintainer** - It might be you

This incident report serves as a reminder: we're all writing legacy code. We're all creating tomorrow's technical debt. The question is whether we're creating it *consciously*.

## Modern Implementation Guide

### Modern Implementation Patterns

The useloader: async asset management of 2045 looks different from 2025. Here's what's changed:

**Architecture:**
```typescript
// Modern pattern - resilient and maintainable
// Accounts for the lessons learned from incidents like this one
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- Modern GPUs handle useLoader differently
- Browser scheduling has evolved
- User expectations have increased
- Mobile devices are more powerful but battery-constrained

**Best Practices:**
1. **Separation of concerns** - Keep rendering logic separate from business logic
2. **State management** - Use modern state libraries designed for 3D contexts
3. **Testing** - Write tests that verify behavior, not implementation
4. **Monitoring** - Instrument your code for observability

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Following outdated tutorials
- Not accounting for browser differences
- Ignoring performance budgets
- Premature abstraction
