**INCIDENT REPORT #3047**
**Date:** 2054-09-25
**Location:** Offshore Digital Preservation Rig (2050)
**Filed By:** Avery Hansen, Museum of Obsolete Patterns Curator
**Classification:** Critical Legacy System Failure
**Subject:** Emergency documentation of 2025-era Pointer Events and Raycasting implementation

I never thought I'd be writing one of these again. We all hoped the Great Migration of 2037 had purged the last of the "primitive 3D era" codebases from our systems. We were wrong.

## The Discovery

The system logs showed anomalies dating back to the original deployment in early 2025. As a Museum of Obsolete Patterns Curator stationed at Offshore Digital Preservation Rig (2050), I've seen my share of questionable implementations, but this pointer events and raycasting setup was something special.

The codebase had all the hallmarks of "early adoption syndrome" - enthusiastic implementation of bleeding-edge features, minimal documentation, and comments like "TODO: Optimize this later" that were never addressed. The "later" is now. And "later" is terrifying.

### Initial Assessment

The pointer events implementation appeared functional on the surface. But deeper inspection revealed patterns that violated every best practice we've established in the intervening decades. The original developers weren't incompetent - they were pioneers working with tools that were brand new. But pioneers don't always survive to see their discoveries become mainstream.

## Technical Analysis

### What They Knew in 2025

The pointer events and raycasting was considered a fundamental building block. The documentation was clear, the examples were plentiful, and developers implemented it with confidence. What they didn't know - what they *couldn't* know - was how these patterns would scale (or fail to scale) over the next 20 years.

### What We Know Now

Modern implementations have evolved significantly. We've learned that pointer events requires careful consideration of:

- **Performance implications** under sustained load
- **Memory management** in long-running applications
- **Compatibility** with emerging hardware capabilities
- **Maintainability** when team members change
- **Scalability** beyond initial use cases

The 2025 approach worked for its time. But time is ruthless to code.

## The Incident

The incident occurred during what should have been routine maintenance. Performance optimizations that made things slower. The pointer events implementation, stable for years, suddenly exhibited behavior that the documentation said was impossible.

### Timeline of Events

**T-0:00** - Initiated standard update procedure
**T+0:15** - First anomalous readings
**T+0:47** - The distant hum of cooling systems
**T+1:23** - System behavior diverged from expected parameters
**T+2:01** - Emergency protocols initiated
**T+2:34** - Fear of touching working code

The logs showed the pointer events and raycasting implementation doing exactly what it was coded to do. That was the problem. What it was coded to do in 2025 was not what we needed it to do in 2046.

### The Horror of Working Code

This wasn't a bug. This was worse than a bug. This was **correct behavior in the wrong context**. The code was functioning perfectly according to its 2025 specifications. But specifications age poorly.

## Resolution and Lessons Learned

### The Fix

The resolution required rewriting the pointer events and raycasting implementation using modern patterns. This wasn't a patch. This was archaeological reconstruction.

We had to:

1. **Understand the original intent** - What were they trying to achieve?
2. **Identify the modern equivalent** - How do we achieve this in 2054?
3. **Migrate without breaking existing integrations** - Other systems depend on this
4. **Document for the next Museum of Obsolete Patterns Curator** - Because we won't be the last

### Lessons Learned

- **Document your assumptions** - The code you write today will be the legacy code someone maintains in 2045
- **Prepare for evolution** - Every abstraction you create should expect the ground to shift beneath it
- **Version your patterns** - What works today might not work tomorrow
- **Have empathy for your future maintainer** - It might be you

This incident report serves as a reminder: we're all writing legacy code. We're all creating tomorrow's technical debt. The question is whether we're creating it *consciously*.

## Modern Implementation Guide

### For Modern Developers

If you're implementing pointer events and raycasting today, here's what you need to know:

**Do:**
- Follow current R3F documentation (not 2025 tutorials)
- Test on modern browsers and hardware
- Consider mobile performance from the start
- Use TypeScript for better maintainability
- Profile performance before optimizing

**Don't:**
- Copy code from old tutorials without understanding it
- Assume patterns that worked in 2025 still work today
- Over-optimize prematurely
- Skip documentation because "the code is self-explanatory"
- Ignore deprecation warnings

**Resources:**
- [Official R3F Documentation](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber)
- [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/)
