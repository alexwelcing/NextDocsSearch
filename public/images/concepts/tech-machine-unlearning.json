  "logline": "An isolated data center's filtration room holds the secrets of machine unlearning.",
  "scene": "In the dimly lit back room of a sprawling data center, a wall of flickering monitors displays streams of code and visualizations of model training data. An old, rusted data purging machine stands ominously in the corner, its mechanical arms clanking as it processes outdated datasets. A thick layer of dust covers the floor, where a technician, dressed in a worn jumpsuit, kneels to inspect the device, troubled by a flashing warning light signaling incomplete deletions. Shadows cast by the machine's harsh, overhead lights flicker across blueprints of neural networks taped to the walls, emphasizing the risk and urgency of erasing the past without leaving traces.",
