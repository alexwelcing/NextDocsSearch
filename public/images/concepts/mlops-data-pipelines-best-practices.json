  "scene": "In a dimly lit control room, technicians hunch over glowing monitors, displaying a flurry of real-time data and model performance graphs. One screen highlights an urgent alert: 'Data Drift Detected - Immediate Action Required.' The tension is palpable as operators scramble to track the source of the anomaly, frantically scouring through historical data logs projected in a holographic format. Nearby, a massive wall-mounted screen illustrates a timeline of data versions, with visual markers indicating discrepancies, like a digital 'Time Machine' showing the evolution of their training datasets.",
