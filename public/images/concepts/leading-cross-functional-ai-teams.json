  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A tense meeting room filled with tension and conflict as scientists and engineers clash over the project deadline.",
  "scene": "In a dimly lit control room, the long conference table is cluttered with laptops, coffee cups, and AI model blueprints. A whiteboard is scrawled with competing timelines: one marked 'Research Phase' with scribbles of complex algorithms, and another labeled 'Delivery Deadline' with strict dates highlighted in red. Data Scientists, with intense expressions, are debating with Software Engineers, gesticulating towards a laptop displaying a live model that is just out of reach. The atmosphere is thick with frustration and urgency, with everyone aware that a decision needs to be made to align their competing interests.",
