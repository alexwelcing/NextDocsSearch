  "logline": "A frayed data server room illuminated by flickering overhead lights reveals the struggle between privacy and analytics.",
  "scene": "In a dimly lit server room, rows of battered servers hum uneasily with the burden of anonymized data. An engineer, clad in a grease-stained jumpsuit, types furiously at an aging terminal, sweat beading on their brow as they grapple with a complex algorithm meant to introduce noise into the data streams. Wires snake across the floor like vines, and a digital display flickers ominously, displaying the diminishing privacy budget. Nearby, a stack of discarded hard drives looms, hinting at the cost of data retrieval gone awry, as the shadows seem to whisper the lost identities entangled within the code.",
