  "archetype": "Quantum Breakthrough",
  "logline": "A sprawling lab with towering quantum computers hums with energy as the team celebrates a groundbreaking discovery.",
  "scene": "Inside a cavernous research facility, rows of colossal quantum processors glimmer under harsh industrial lights, their intricate circuits pulsating with blue and green luminescence. In the foreground, a group of weary but exhilarated researchers gathers around a central holographic display, which flickers with data streams and fractal visualizations of quantum coherence. Beer bottles and champagne flutes adorn a nearby table, scattered amidst hastily scribbled equations and coffee-stained notebooks. One researcher gestures animatedly at the projection, the excitement palpable in the air as they grasp the magnitude of their unexpected breakthrough.",
