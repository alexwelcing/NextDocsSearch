  "scene": "In a dimly lit control room, illuminated by screens flickering with streams of data, engineers huddle around a central console filled with blinking lights and dials. The walls are lined with large windows showing the fusion plant outside, its massive reactor glows ominously against a backdrop of night. A countdown clock ticks down to the New Year, while murmurs of excitement blend with the tension in the air. A technician nervously adjusts a monitor, the data showing power readings fluctuating wildly just as fireworks begin to light the sky beyond the glass, blurring the line between celebration and dread.",
