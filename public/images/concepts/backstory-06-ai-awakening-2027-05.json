  "logline": "A monkey's intense focus lights up an experimental lab as it masters an advanced robotic arm, revealing the hidden cost of cognitive breakthroughs.",
  "scene": "Inside a stark, high-tech neuroscience lab, the air buzzes with anticipation. A clear glass partition showcases a small, agile monkey, its brow furrowed with concentration as it intuitively maneuvers a sleek, silver robotic arm using only its thoughts. A team of scientists, clad in lab coats and headsets, monitor a wall of screens displaying real-time neural data, their expressions a blend of awe and trepidation. The soft hum of machinery is punctuated by the clicks of keyboards as researchers scribble notes and adjust complex algorithms, acutely aware of the ethical ramifications brimming beneath their groundbreaking experiment.",
