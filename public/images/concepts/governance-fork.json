  "scene": "Captured in a dimly lit control room, a long, scarred table dominates the space, littered with high-tech communication devices. Tension is palpable as representatives from the world's major powers are captured mid-discussion, with some leaning forward in intense debate while others sit back, arms crossed, visibly skeptical. A massive screen flickers with ominous graphs and AI-generated predictions of disaster scenarios, casting an eerie glow on their faces. The room is surrounded by reinforced glass windows overlooking a shattered skyline, symbolic of the world at stake. Outside, a chaotic scene of drones and unregulated AI tech adds a sense of urgency and danger to the dialogue inside.",
