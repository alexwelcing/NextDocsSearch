  "scene": "In a dimly lit, utilitarian conference room, a long table stretches out, cluttered with digital tablets and printed risk assessment reports. An overhead projector displays a stark threat matrix, pulsating with indicators of potential disaster scenarios. Shadowy figures loom over the table, their faces etched with worry, as they engage in heated debate, the air thick with the weight of what lies ahead. A glass wall reveals a lab through which ghostly silhouettes of engineers can be seen working on the cutting-edge technology, oblivious to the chaos of the planning session.",
