  "archetype": "Timestamp Collapse",
  "logline": "A shattered courtroom, strewn with fabricated documents and digital evidence, embodies the chaos of a world where timestamps have lost their meaning.",
  "scene": "The camera pans across a dilapidated courtroom, where the judge's bench is cluttered with holographic displays flickering between false legal documents and AI-generated evidence. In the foreground, a worn wooden gavel lies abandoned, symbolizing the breakdown of legal authority. A large screen displays images of digitally manipulated timestamps, overlapping and distorting the reality of the evidence presented. Shadows of disillusioned lawyers flicker in the background, their faces obscured as they grapple with the untrustworthiness of what they once held sacred. The air is thick with tension, painting a picture of a society on the brink of epistemic collapse.",
