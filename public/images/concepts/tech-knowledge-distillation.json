  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A tangle of cables and glowing interfaces fills a dimly lit control room as a beleaguered engineer monitors a digital simulation of knowledge distillation.",
  "scene": "In a cluttered control room, an engineer leans over a holographic display emanating from a cracked console, sweat glistening on their brow as they navigate through layers of complex data visualization. Screens flicker with streaming algorithms, showcasing the stark contrast between a bulky teacher model and its sleek, distilled counterpart. The atmosphere is tense; the engineer’s fingers dart between controls as they attempt to balance the performance of these models against the stark reality of computational limitations. Outside the reinforced glass, a bleak urban skyline looms, hinting at a world dependent on effective AI solutions. Every beep and whir of the machines is a countdown to success or failure, amplifying the feeling of urgency.",
