  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A tense moment unfolds in a sterile gene-editing lab, where scientists grapple with the consequences of precise genetic manipulation.",
  "scene": "Inside a high-tech CRISPR laboratory, a large glass panel reveals the intricate machinery used for gene editing. Scientists in lab coats, faces illuminated by screens, monitor the live data streaming from a cutting-edge sequencer, assessing on-target efficiency and off-target risks. Tension escalates as an unexpected alert flashes: multiple potential off-target effects detected. One researcher clutches a tablet, his eyes wide, as he realizes their guide RNA design may have unintended consequences—threatening the entire project. The sterile environment is juxtaposed with the urgency of a life-altering decision.",
