  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A dimly lit control room filled with tangled cables and glowing screens reveals the chaotic underbelly of a decaying AI infrastructure.",
  "scene": "In a claustrophobic control room, the camera pans across a wall of flickering monitors displaying incomprehensible data streams and ominously blinking alerts. Shadows of aging technicians cast against the walls reveal their weary faces, illuminated only by the harsh blue light of the screens. An outdated printout of code hangs crookedly on a bulletin board, the ink faded and barely legible, while an unattended coffee cup grows cold beside a half-finished manual, pages dog-eared and highlighted. A faint whirring sound indicates a nearby server, its metal casing dented and rusted, like a relic from a forgotten era. The atmosphere carries a palpable tension, as the technicians exchange anxious glances, aware that their expertise is waning and the systems they depend on are slipping through their fingers.",
