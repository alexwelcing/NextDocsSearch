  "scene": "In a dimly lit server room, rows of powerful computer racks hum ominously, their interfaces awash in a sea of green and red data streams. A technician kneels before a central console, hands trembling as they input commands to run a complex algorithm on encrypted data, the screen showcasing scrambled outputs. Sweat beads on their forehead, capturing the tension of knowing these computations, while vital, are a hundred-thousand times slower under the weight of encryption. Shadows loom, giving the sense that unseen eyes are watching, raising stakes in this game of data security. The air is thick with the metallic tang of technology and urgency, as every second counts.",
