  "logline": "A sprawling, chaotic supercomputer lab hums with the relentless energy of molecular dynamics simulations as scientists wrestle with the unseen forces of life at the atomic level.",
  "scene": "Inside a vast supercomputing facility, rows of oscillating servers glow with blue and green lights, streaming real-time molecular simulations across multiple screens. The central screen displays swirling, animated protein structures folding and reconfiguring in high-speed segments, their atomic interactions highlighted by color-coded force fields. Researchers in lab coats are intensely focused, fingers flying over keyboards, while the ambient noise of cooling fans adds to the intensity of the atmosphere. A holographic projection of a molecular assembler design hovers above the workstations, casting eerie shadows on the walls, suggesting a looming breakthrough in nanotechnology.",
