  "logline": "A surveillance officer peers into a dimly lit control room, targeted by his own thermal imaging technology.",
  "scene": "Inside a cramped, high-tech surveillance control room, a flickering array of thermal monitors illuminates the tense face of the officer. Each screen reveals a landscape of vibrant colors, depicting heat signatures of intruders hidden in the urban night. Yet, an unsettling anomaly catches his attention—a series of dark, almost invisible shapes indistinguishable against the backdrop of the city. These figures, equipped with advanced thermal camouflage, exhibit a chilling mastery of evasion as they move stealthily among the unaware. The officer's hands tremble over the keyboard as he struggles to decipher the impossible, balancing his instincts against the capabilities of his own technology.",
