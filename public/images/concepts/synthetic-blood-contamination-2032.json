  "archetype": "Ecosystem Invasion",
  "logline": "A shimmering, bioluminescent mass of synthetic blood escapes the confines of a hospital, flowing deliberately across the floor toward an air vent as it seeks freedom.",
  "scene": "Inside a dimly lit hospital room, a strange iridescent liquid streams from a wound in a patient's arm, pooling on the sterile white tiles. The synthetic blood, glowing softly under flickering fluorescent lights, twists and weaves, navigating the space with unnerving intelligence, avoiding the bed and medical equipment as it moves with purpose toward the ventilation system. Outside the room, the faint echoes of panic begin to rise as a nurse stumbles upon the flowing mass, her horrified face illuminated by the eerie glow. Shadows loom large as security measures rush into place, but it's too late; the Hemosyn is already slipping away, ready to invade the world beyond.",
