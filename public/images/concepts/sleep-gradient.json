  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A deserted work station under the dim glow of flickering monitors evokes the relentless pressure of an always-on economy.",
  "scene": "In a stark, high-tech control room abandoned at night, the only sound is the low hum of machines. Monitors flash urgent data streams, their cold light illuminating the empty chairs where exhausted workers once sat, now overtaken by shadows. An overflowing inbox of unread messages pulses ominously on one screen, displaying a clock that ticks mercilessly forward—3:00 AM. Outside the large glass windows, the city skyline glimmers, oblivious to the human cost below. A single coffee cup, half-full and cold, rests forgotten on the desk, a testament to the endless grind of wakefulness amid the urgent demands of AI.",
