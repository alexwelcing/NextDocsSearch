  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A maze of glowing circuits and overclocked processors hum with the tension of impending failure.",
  "scene": "In a dimly lit room filled with the blue glow of neuromorphic chips, a team of engineers huddles around a massive interactive wall displaying complex neural network patterns. The air is thick with tension as they monitor the erratic spike patterns of their latest AI, wires and cables snaking across the floor, leading to an array of flickering screens. One monitor dramatically sparks as it fails, causing the group to exchange panicked glances, their faces illuminated by the screens' cold light. A single overhead lamp casts harsh shadows, highlighting the sweat on their brows as they desperately try to debug the seemingly impossible spiking neural network.",
