  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A chaotic control room filled with blinking consoles and frantic engineers monitors a holographic display of a quantum circuit grappling with error correction.",
  "scene": "Inside a dimly-lit control room, engineers in lab coats pace anxiously around an enormous, interactive hologram displaying a complex quantum circuit grid. The air hums with tension as they track multiple data streams and erratic error messages flickering across various screens. One engineer frantically points to a visual representation of qubit states, while another types commands into a console, sweat glistening on their brow. The ambient glow of red warning lights contrasts starkly against the cool blue of the hologram, highlighting the high stakes of quantum error correction.",
