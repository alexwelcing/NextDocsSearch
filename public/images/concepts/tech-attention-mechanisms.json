  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A cluttered command center with flickering screens displays streams of highlighted neural pathways.",
  "scene": "Inside a dimly lit control room, the camera pans across a series of weathered monitors, each showcasing the chaotic flow of data being processed by advanced NLP models. The screens are filled with intricate, animated graphs illustrating multi-head self-attention at work, with certain sections of text illuminated in bright pulses to depict focus points. Engineers huddle around the cluttered desks, frantically typing commands while peering into the visualizations of context limits that threaten to unravel their progress. A wall-mounted holographic display periodically flashes alarming red warnings about context length constraints, creating a sense of urgency in the air.",
