  "archetype": "Neural Nexus",
  "logline": "A sterile, high-tech surgical room hums with anticipation as the first bidirectional brain interface is implanted into a volunteer.",
  "scene": "The surgical room is filled with the eerie glow of diagnostic screens, each displaying intricate neural pathways and brain activity patterns. A slender, metallic arm extends from a robotic rig, delicately inserting a cloud of nanofibers into the volunteer's skull, their eyes wide open, reflecting the intense blue light of the monitors. Surgeons in clean white lab coats monitor both the machinery and the volunteer, whose expression betrays a mix of fear and hope. Every beep and flash of light serves as a reminder of the gravity of this moment—the frontier of human enhancement.",
