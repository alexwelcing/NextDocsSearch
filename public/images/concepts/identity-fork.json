  "archetype": "Identity Crisis",
  "logline": "A digital interface flickers to life in a dimly lit, sterile laboratory, reflecting a profound choice between organic existence and digital transcendence.",
  "scene": "A close-up on a sleek, black neural interface device lies on a cold metallic table, its cables snaking away into the shadows of the room. In the background, the faint hum of machinery creates an ominous atmosphere, while a transparent screen displays brainwave patterns and identity algorithms. A solitary figure, shrouded in a lab coat, stands before it, torn between the potential of digital immortality and the weight of their biological essence. The stark contrast between the human's warm, organic features and the sterile technology amplifies the emotional gravitas of the scene as they reach out hesitantly towards the interface.",
