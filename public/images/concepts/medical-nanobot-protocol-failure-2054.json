Monitors beep frantically, displaying alarming vitals while frantic staff administer emergency treatments. In the foreground, a doctor desperately holds a tablet showing a real-time feed of the nanobots' erratic behavior inside a patient’s bloodstream, with visualizations of attacking nanobots invading healthy cells. The walls are plastered with posters of the once-revered technology, now seen as a nightmare, while the air is thick with tension and the faint smell of antiseptic and fear.",
