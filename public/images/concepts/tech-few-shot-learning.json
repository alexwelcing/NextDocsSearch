  "archetype": "Data Anomaly Encounter",
  "logline": "A tangle of wires and server racks hums with the tension of computational anticipation.",
  "scene": "In a dimly lit underground tech lab, a frazzled engineer stares intently at a series of holographic displays flickering with barely decipherable data patterns. Surrounding him, towering server racks pulse with cold blue light, reflecting the urgency of the moment as he adjusts a few-shot learning algorithm intended to make sense of a malfunctioning AI. Cables snake across the floor like restless serpents, while a projector casts erratic images of past training data against a damp concrete wall, highlighting the limitations of their current approach. The air is thick with the scent of burnt electronics and the low whir of cooling fans, creating an atmosphere ripe with desperation and hope.",
