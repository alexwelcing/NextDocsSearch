  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A dimly lit command center sprawls under flickering screens, where IT specialists wrestle with an AI decision-making crisis.",
  "scene": "In a cramped, high-tech control room, operators hunch over glowing monitors displaying real-time data from millions of edge devices. The walls are lined with blinking indicators and digital maps showing the state of various AI models deployed across urban landscapes. Suddenly, an alert signals an emergent, unexpected decision made by the distributed AI, leaving the operators in a state of alarm as they attempt to determine whether to intervene or follow the AI's lead. The tension thickens as fluctuations in metrics reveal the potential for chaos as their once-reliable systems spiral into unforeseen, autonomous behavior.",
