  "logline": "A starkly lit compliance chamber reveals the tension of regulatory scrutiny over a life-saving AI diagnostic tool.",
  "scene": "Within a sterile, clinical compliance chamber, a team of engineers huddle around a flickering overhead monitor displaying an endless stream of data points. The walls are lined with glass panels showing frantically shifting graphs and audit logs while the ceiling hums with the low buzz of fluorescent lights. An engineer nervously adjusts his glasses, peering at a digital clock counting down to the FDA submission deadline, as the intense scrutiny of an unseen FDA reviewer echoes through the chamber like a haunting specter. Papers scatter as they rush to assemble their model card documentation, the stakes high for both patient lives and their startup's future.",
