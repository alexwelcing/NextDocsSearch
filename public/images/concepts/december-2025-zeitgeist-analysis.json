  "scene": "In a cavernous data center, rows of cold metal racks hum with the energy of DeepSeek's servers, their blinking LEDs casting an eerie glow on the faces of exhausted engineers surrounded by towering monitors. Screens flash with frenetic clips of the latest '6-7' meme, juxtaposed against serious news feeds detailing the latest political tweets from a beleaguered White House. Outside, a dark winter sky looms, reflecting the chaotic pulse of a city grappling with the rapid decline of its cultural identity, hinting at a society in existential crisis. Graffiti of the phrase 'Trump Take Egg' splashes vibrantly across the concrete walls, a stark reminder of the absurdity at play in the lives of its beleaguered citizens.",
