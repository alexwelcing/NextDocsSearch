  "logline": "A disheveled AI research lab, cluttered with screens and disassembled hardware, reveals the chaos of generative AI’s rapid evolution.",
  "scene": "Dimly lit by the flickering glow of multiple monitors, the cramped workspace is filled with discarded components—a broken drone, half-printed circuit boards, and tangled wires. In the foreground, a weary engineer furrows their brow as they scrutinize a chaotic dashboard filled with data visualizations generated by an AI, struggling to comprehend the insights from its erratic suggestions. The walls are plastered with whiteboards covered in complex algorithms and scribbled notes about emergent patterns being explored, hinting at the frantic pace of innovation. An eerie hum of cooling fans provides a backdrop, amplifying the sense of urgency and confusion in the air.",
