  "scene": "Inside a vast, sterile lab space that stretches into the distance, rows of server racks tower like monolithic sculptures, each one blinking with rhythmic green LED lights. Researchers in lab coats huddle around a central console, their eyes glued to the screens displaying complex data visualizations and metric analyses. The air is thick with anticipation and the faint hum of cooling fans provides a background symphony of technological prowess. A massive wall-mounted screen displays the haunting question: 'When does reasoning begin?', as a team member scribbles frantic notes, signaling the weight of the moment.",
