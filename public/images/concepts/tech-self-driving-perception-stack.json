  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A chaotic dashboard illuminated by flickering screens displays real-time data from an array of sensors, while a tense technician monitors a cityscape through a panoramic glass wall.",
  "scene": "The camera pans across a dimly lit control room filled with a disarray of tangled cables and blinking lights. A technician, focused yet anxious, peers at a holographic display projecting a live 3D map of the surrounding urban landscape, noting anomalies highlighted by the sensor data. Outside, the metallic silhouette of self-driving cars glides past, their sleek forms reflecting the stark glow of streetlights. Each car is augmented with visible sensors—LiDAR and cameras—scanning the environment, struggling to navigate a sudden downpour that distorts visibility and challenges the perception stack.",
