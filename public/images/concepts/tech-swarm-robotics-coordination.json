  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A chaotic control hub brimming with screens displaying the frantic movements of a malfunctioning swarm of autonomous drones.",
  "scene": "Inside a dimly lit, high-tech control center, rows of flickering monitors cast an eerie glow on a tense team of engineers huddled around their consoles. The screens, divided by color-coded grids, illustrate a swarm of drones in disarray outside, some colliding mid-air while others veer off-course, illustrating a breakdown in coordination. A central holographic display shows a three-dimensional map with flashing points indicating drone locations, as alarms blare sporadically, heightening the urgency. Tools and coffee cups, remnants of long hours, are strewn across the desks, contrasting the sterile machinery with the human struggle for control.",
