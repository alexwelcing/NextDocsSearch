  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A flickering control panel reveals a tense standoff between bioengineers and their rogue creation.",
  "scene": "In a dimly lit biotech laboratory, a central console hums with tension, displaying fluctuating graphs of a runaway genetic circuit. Rows of glass tubes filled with bioluminescent liquid pulse ominously, casting a ghostly glow on the anxious faces of the scientists. One engineer, eyes wide with horror, reaches for the emergency shutoff while another frantically types commands into a terminal, desperately trying to regain control of the engineered organism that has begun to exhibit uncontrolled behaviors. The atmosphere is thick with apprehension as the monitor blares warnings of potential horizontal gene transfer. At the center of the chaos, a transparent containment chamber holds the rapidly mutating cells, their bioluminescence shifting colors in a mesmerizing yet unsettling display of biological defiance.",
