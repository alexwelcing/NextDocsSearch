  "scene": "Rows of towering servers pulse with neon-blue lights, casting shadows on the faces of engineers who are glued to their screens, scrutinizing lines of code as they fine-tune the HNSW algorithm. In the foreground, a close-up shows an engineer’s hands frantically typing on a keyboard, sweat glistening on their brow, while behind them, a massive digital display visualizes the intricate web of vector embeddings and their relationships. Above, a flickering overhead light reveals an air vent spewing dust, hinting at the decay of the tech that powers their high-stakes work, while the smell of overheated machinery lingers in the air.",
