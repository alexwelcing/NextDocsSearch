  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A high-tech lab filled with intricate equipment and swirling holographic displays, where researchers battle the enigmatic nature of protein folding.",
  "scene": "Inside a dimly lit, sterile laboratory, a large cylindrical tank filled with a viscous solution bubbles ominously. On the walls, oversized screens display complex protein structures in vibrant 3D, shifting dynamically as if alive. A tense group of scientists hunch over their consoles, surrounded by glass vials and refracting lasers that analyze samples with precision. In a moment of frustration, one scientist slams a palm against a control panel, blurring a crucial protein structure on-screen that suddenly flickers, revealing a catastrophic conformation error due to misfolding. Outside the lab's reinforced glass, shadows of other researchers loom, whispering the implications of their failure.",
