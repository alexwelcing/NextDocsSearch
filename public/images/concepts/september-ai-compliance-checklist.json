  "scene": "In a cramped, high-tech control room, walls are lined with monitors displaying a chaotic array of alerts and notifications. A lone Product Manager, visibly stressed, stares at a countdown timer ticking down to the audit deadline, surrounded by scattered papers and frantic team members on headsets logging urgent calls. The atmosphere is thick with tension, and a holographic projection of the audit checklist hovers ominously above the table, illuminating faces of anxiety. In the background, wires and machines pulse rhythmically, reinforcing the urgent pulse of technology managing data under scrutiny.",
