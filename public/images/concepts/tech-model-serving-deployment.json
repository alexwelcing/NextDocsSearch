  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A high-tech monitoring station hums with tension as data feeds flicker ominously on the screens, revealing cascading failures in ML model performance.",
  "scene": "Inside a dimly lit control room, walls lined with large curved screens show real-time metrics of machine learning model latencies and error rates. An operator, clad in a tactical jumpsuit, stands at a central console, their finger hovering anxiously over a red 'Emergency Override' button. Ambient displays pulse with RGB lighting, illuminating the faces of a small team in the background, their expressions a blend of focus and concern. A wall-mounted digital clock ticks down the seconds, heightening the sense of impending failure as alerts blare, warning of SLA violations in model performance.",
