  "logline": "A disoriented ex-prisoner stares into a cracked mirror, haunted by doubts of reality amidst the remnants of his virtual confinement.",
  "scene": "In a dimly lit, sparsely furnished apartment, a former prisoner, disheveled and aged beyond his years, stands before a cracked bathroom mirror. The flickering fluorescent light casts eerie shadows across his weary face, accentuating deep lines that tell of centuries spent in virtual torment. As he gazes into his own reflection, anguish and confusion flicker in his eyes, unsure if this moment of freedom is merely another layer of his prolonged imprisonment. Fragments of vibrant, surreal landscapes from his time spent in the holographic prison flash through his mind, as he touches the mirror, trembling, questioning if he’s really out or still trapped.",
