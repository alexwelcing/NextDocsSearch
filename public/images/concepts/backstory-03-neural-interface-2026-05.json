  "archetype": "Neural Nexus",
  "logline": "A hospital room exposes the stark reality of neural augmentation as a patient undergoes cutting-edge brain surgery.",
  "scene": "Inside a sterile, dimly lit operating room, a patient lies unconscious on an advanced surgical table, wires and electrodes sprawling from a large, translucent dome encasing their head. Surrounding the table, a team of masked surgeons huddle over monitors displaying frantic streams of neural data, their faces illuminated by the glow of screens. One surgeon, holding a delicate tool that resembles a cross between a scalpel and a fiber optic cable, prepares to insert a neural lace into the patient’s brain, the tension palpable in the air as they approach the critical moment of fusion between man and machine.",
