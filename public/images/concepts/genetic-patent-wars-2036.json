  "scene": "The courtroom stands stark and bare, its cold walls a muted gray, illuminated by harsh overhead lights. In the foreground, Jennifer Wu’s chair is empty, the only evidence of her presence a discarded cease-and-desist letter that has fluttered to the floor, a stark reminder of the corporate takeover of her very being. In the background, a judge’s gavel rests ominously on the bench, symbolizing the weight of legal authority that crushes personal freedom. The air is thick with tension, as corporate lawyers whisper among themselves, their faces obscured by shadows, while the faint echo of a distant clock ticking adds to the sense of impending doom. Outside the window, a digital billboard flashes the logos of biotech companies, a constant reminder of the world that now owns human genetics.",
