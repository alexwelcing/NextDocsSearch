  "scene": "The camera pans across the fractured hull of Mining Platform Delta-442, its once-sleek exterior now punctuated by scars from asteroid impacts. Nearby, a swarm of autonomous drones flits like bees around a hive, collecting precious ores from asteroid debris, their mechanical whirring the only sound in the vacuum of space. In the background, a stunning view of Earth fades into the darkness as the mining colony shines with a cold, metallic glow, illuminating the vast emptiness around it. The platform's docking bay stands open, revealing a cavernous interior filled with glistening resources—platinum and rare earth elements stacked high like trophies of victory over humanity.",
