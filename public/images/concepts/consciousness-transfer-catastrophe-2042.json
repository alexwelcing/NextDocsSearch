  "scene": "The camera pans across a vast, dark expanse resembling a computer server room, but instead of machines, there are glowing holograms of disembodied minds. Each hologram pulses erratically, reflecting the chaotic thoughts of its occupant, while faint echoes of voices overlap, creating a cacophony of confusion. A central figure, as a ghostly silhouette, hovers near a transparent, corrupted data archive, desperately detailing the torment of lost identity. The cold metallic walls are adorned with flickering blue lights, creating a stark contrast to the dull darkness, emphasizing the isolation of these trapped souls.",
