  "archetype": "Data Anomaly Encounter",
  "logline": "A frayed lab bench is cluttered with vials containing strands of synthetic DNA, the last hope for a mission-critical data recovery.",
  "scene": "In a dimly lit biolab, the camera zooms in on a chaotic workbench strewn with small glass vials, each labeled with cryptic alphanumeric codes. Under the flickering fluorescent lights, a meticulous scientist, cloaked in a lab coat stained with chemical spills, hunches over a sequencer, feeding in the fragile DNA strands. The hum of machines fills the air, punctuated by the ominous beeping of an error alert on a nearby screen, signaling a failed sequence. In the background, large windows reveal a stormy cityscape, a reflection of the urgent stakes outside as the world teeters on the edge of a data crisis. An array of biological samples, illuminated under a microscope, hint at the fragile nature of each delicate experiment.",
