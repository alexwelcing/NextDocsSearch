  "scene": "Inside a cramped, high-tech control room, dozens of illuminated monitors display complex graphs and real-time data streams from multiple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) experiments. An engineer, furiously typing commands, peers anxiously at a massive holographic projection of the latest architecture, which pulses ominously with each iteration. The walls are lined with stacks of heavy machinery and cooling units, providing a gritty atmosphere of urgency as warnings of 'Runaway Optimization' flash across the screens. In the background, a faint whirring noise echoes as robotic arms meticulously assemble chips based on the evolving designs.",
