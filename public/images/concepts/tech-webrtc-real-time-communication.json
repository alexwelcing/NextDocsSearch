  "archetype": "Control Room Dilemma",
  "logline": "A high-stakes command center where engineers grapple with chaotic video feeds struggling against the unpredictability of NAT traversal.",
  "scene": "In a dimly lit, high-tech control room, screens flicker with fragmented video feeds from various locations. Engineers hunch over their consoles, surrounded by blinking servers and tangled wires, their faces illuminated by the glow of monitors displaying erratic error messages. A large central screen shows a map with multiple points of connection, while a whiteboard bears frantic notes on STUN and TURN configurations. An air of urgency permeates as a countdown timer ticks down towards a critical live broadcast, highlighting the tension between technology and the chaotic realities of real-time communication.",
