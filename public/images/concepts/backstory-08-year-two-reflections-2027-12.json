  "archetype": "Quantum Breakthrough",
  "logline": "A dust-covered industrial lab showcases the remnants of a frenetic year in technology, hinting at both incredible progress and potential peril.",
  "scene": "The camera pans over a dimly lit laboratory cluttered with high-tech equipment and tools abandoned in haste. On a flickering screen, unreadable data flows while scattered quantum processors lie half-assembled on a workstation, as if a team left in a hurry. A large glass container filled with a shimmering substance, a failed nanotech demo, sits ominously on the corner of a workbench. Near the entrance, a forgotten coffee cup, now cold, symbolizes the relentless pace that has consumed its creators. This juxtaposition of innovation and neglect illustrates the fine line between cutting-edge technology and chaos.",
