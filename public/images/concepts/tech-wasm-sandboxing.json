  "logline": "A dimly lit tech lab brimming with tension as engineers survey the aftermath of a security breach.",
  "scene": "The camera sweeps over a cluttered workstation filled with wiry circuit boards and half-assembled modules. Shadows dance across the walls, revealing a series of monitors displaying lines of code and ominous red warnings flashing intermittently. Engineers in lab coats huddle over a central console, their faces stern and anxious, as they grapple with the implications of a failed WASM sandboxing test. A single flickering light bulb above casts an eerie glow, reflecting the palpable uncertainty surrounding the fate of their untrusted code. In the background, a locked glass chamber contains remnants of prior experiments, hinting at the fragility of their technological advancements.",
