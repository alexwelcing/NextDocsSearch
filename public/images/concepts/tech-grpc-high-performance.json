  "scene": "The camera pulls back to reveal a dimly lit server room where rows of sleek, modular servers hum with energy. Each unit is connected by a complex web of neon-lit cables, resembling a digital spider's web, reflecting data packets zipping through. A nearby monitor displays fluctuating graphs and escalating latency alerts in vivid colors, hinting at an imminent failure. Technicians in heavy-duty gear scramble amidst the machinery, their faces illuminated by the eerie glow of screens as they communicate through headsets, battling an escalating data anomaly. The tension hangs thick in the air, mixing urgency and high stakes.",
