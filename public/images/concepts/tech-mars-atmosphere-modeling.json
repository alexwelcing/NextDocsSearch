  "logline": "A weathered control panel flickers ominously, revealing a spiraling visual of Mars' warming atmosphere.",
  "scene": "Inside a dimly lit terraforming control room, engineers and scientists huddle around a massive curved screen displaying a dynamic simulation of Mars’ atmosphere. Green and red graphs pulse ominously, indicating rising temperatures and CO2 levels. Steam rises from a nearby metal canister labeled 'SF6', hinting at the volatile gas being prepared for release. Each beep and glitch of the technology heightens the tension as a digital warning flashes: 'RUNAWAY RISK'. A stark view of the barren Martian landscape through a reinforced window contrasts sharply with the chaos inside, symbolizing the delicate balance of scientific ambition and environmental peril.",
