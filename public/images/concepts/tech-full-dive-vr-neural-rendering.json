  "scene": "In a dimly lit control room, an array of screens showcases hyper-realistic environments generated by neural networks, each depicting far-off planets covered in vibrant bioluminescent flora. A technician, with weary eyes and disheveled hair, intently monitors the visuals while calibrating the sophisticated eye-tracking equipment that will allow users to navigate seamlessly through that virtual space. The atmosphere is thick with tension as the technician realizes that the immersive experience has become almost indistinguishable from reality, leading to ethical dilemmas surrounding VR addiction. Beneath the console, cables snake like organic veins, connecting the system to its power source, pulsating with life.",
