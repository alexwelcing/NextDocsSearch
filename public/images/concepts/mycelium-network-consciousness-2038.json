  "archetype": "Evolutionary Awakening",
  "logline": "A dense network of glowing mycelium pulses with life underneath a terracotta landscape, signaling humanity's first contact with Earth's ancient consciousness.",
  "scene": "Set in a lush, dimly-lit rainforest, a team of researchers huddles around a complex array of quantum sensors and bio-electromagnetic interfaces. The roots of towering trees intertwine with the luminous, bioluminescent mycelium glowing faintly in a spectrum of greens and blues, signifying communication. As they transmit electrical pulses into the network, spectral patterns of light shift and converge, creating a web of energy that dances in response. The atmosphere is charged with anticipation as each pulse reveals a deeper connection to the ancient intelligence beneath their feet, illuminating the profound bond between humanity and the Earth’s living systems.",
