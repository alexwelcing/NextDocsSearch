  "logline": "A stark newsroom bathed in the sterile glow of a single omnipotent screen, dominating an entire wall with content generated by the world's only AI.",

The atmosphere is heavy with suspicion and resignation, as they engage in a disheartening task: shaping the output of a singular AI to fit human standards while knowing it lacks true creativity. The room is filled with empty coffee cups and the remnants of hastily discarded drafts, a testament to the struggle against a growing cultural monoculture.",
