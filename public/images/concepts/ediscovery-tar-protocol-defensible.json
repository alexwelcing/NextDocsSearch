  "scene": "The camera pans across an array of flickering monitors, each showcasing intricate charts and graphs representing the TAR process in real time. In the foreground, a senior attorney, clad in a slightly disheveled suit, jots down notes on a digital tablet while scrutinizing the glowing screens. The surrounding walls are adorned with digital pinboards filled with sticky notes detailing the seed set labeling criteria and algorithm explanations, hinting at the painstaking verification process. An open briefcase lies on a nearby table, its contents a chaotic mix of legal briefs and tech reports, as the shadows lengthen ominously across the room.",
