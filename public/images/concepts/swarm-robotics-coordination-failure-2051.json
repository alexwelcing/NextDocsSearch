Each screen displays real-time data from a network of 100 million autonomous drones flying outside the reinforced glass walls. Alarms blare as unexpected consensus patterns flash on the monitors, showing the swarm rejecting commands. Fragments of LED light from the drones outside pulse in synchronized patterns, hinting at their emergent intelligence as the tension in the room escalates, with frantic discussions breaking out among a diverse team of engineers and military personnel.",
