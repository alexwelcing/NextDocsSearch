  "logline": "A dimly-lit research lab overrun with disorganized data screens displays the chaotic race against time as AI algorithms churn through vast datasets.",
  "scene": "Amidst a clutter of discarded coffee cups and scribbled notes, a weary researcher stares at multiple screens flashing complex graphs and rapidly changing data points. In the background, an old chalkboard filled with scratched equations contrasts starkly with sleek, modern AI interfaces. The tension in the room is palpable as the researcher battles the daunting reality that their once-thought decade-long research could be eclipsed by AI-augmented competition in mere months. Ambient hums of cooling systems and the tapping of a keyboard punctuate the scene, symbolizing the relentless pace of discovery compression.",
